Dawn Addis,Addis Issues Statement on President Trump's Executive Order to Dismantle the Department of Education,2025-03-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO—Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) issued the following statement in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.
""As a mother of two college students who rely on financial aid, just like millions of other students across America, I know firsthand that education is the foundation of a strong resilient nation.
The President’s decision to dismantle the Department of Education is a blatant disregard for students, families, and educators. It strips opportunity from millions, and puts jobs on the line.
We anticipated actions like this, which is why the we set aside funding to defend California against such reckless moves. We are not standing back. We are fighting.
As a former special education teacher and Chair of the Select Committee on Serving Students with Disabilities, I stand ready to ensure that California’s diverse student body is protected, and I look forward to continuing the fight alongside my colleagues in the state legislature to protect every student’s right to learn, grow, and succeed.""

The bill renames the fund to the Two-Spirit, Transgender, Gender Nonconforming, and Intersex (2TGI) Wellness and Equity Fund and broadens its scope to better serve 2TGI individuals across California.
AB 1487 expands the definition of health care to include mental health care and extends grant eligibility funding to support programs that provide:
“As federal attacks escalate and attempts to erase people’s identity intensify, California cannot be complacent,” said Addis. “When policies or people waver, real commitment means standing firm, and not shifting with the political winds. AB 1487 strengthens this critical fund to ensure Two-Spirit, Transgender, Gender Nonconforming, and Intersex (2TGI) individuals receive the support they need to thrive, including access to health care, job training, and social integration programs.”
This bill is sponsored by the TransLatin@ Coalition, a nationally recognized organization that provides essential services to TGI individuals in 10 states across the country.
“AB 1487 will provide the much needed supportive services to all members of the Two Spirit, Trans, Genderexpansive and Intersex (2TGI) community in California,” said Bamby Salcedo, President/CEO of TransLatin@ Coalition “We are grateful for the leadership and support from Assemblymember Dawn Addis for understanding the importance of supporting organizations that provide services to 2TGI people, particularly In this political climate which is denying the ability for 2TGI people to be able to thrive. AB 1478 is a lifesaving legislation to all 2TGI people in California.”
AB 1487 now awaits referral to its first policy committee.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Legislation to Bolster Community Choice & Environmental Protections in Battery Projects,2025-01-25,press_release,NA,"MORRO BAY—Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced the Battery Energy Safety & Accountability Act (AB 303) to improve safety standards and restore local oversight for energy storage facilities in California. The bill comes on the heels of growing concerns following recent incidents, including the Moss Landing lithium-ion battery facility fire last week.
AB 303 would require critical local engagement in the permitting process for battery or energy storage facilities, and create environmental setback requirements for sensitive areas, including schools, hospitals, and natural habitats.
""AB 303 is a proactive measure that will ensure companies like Vistra go through the normal, local, regulatory process,"" said Addis ""It is designed to build trust, increase safety, and give communities a choice, by restoring local community processes for permitting these projects.""
At a press conference in Moss Landing on Thursday, Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church expressed his full backing of AB 303.
""What we have now are rather haphazard regulations on this relatively new industry,"" said Church. ""I appreciate the aspects inside of it [AB 303] that will allow local control. This is what democracy is all about.""
AB 303 now awaits referral to its first policy committee.

Dawn Addis,Addis Calls for Investigation of Moss Landing Fire,2025-01-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today urged the California Public Utilities Commission to conduct an independent investigation on the fire at the Vistra Battery Energy Storage System at the Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County.
Addis sent the following letter to Alice Busching Reynolds, the President of the California Public Utilities Commission:
January 22, 2025
Alice Busching Reynolds, PresidentCalifornia Public Utilities Commission505 Van Ness AvenueSan Francisco, CA 94102
Dear President Busching Reynolds,
We are writing to formally request an independent investigation and action in regards to the January 2025 fire that lasted five days at the Vistra Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) at the Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County. Specifically, we are asking for a fully transparent and independent investigation, updated safety enforcement, prevention enhancements, and for the Vistra BESS to remain offline until safety is guaranteed. I thank Governor Newsom and my colleagues at the local and state levels for joining ongoing calls for such an investigation.
As state legislators, we have the honor of representing hundreds of miles of California's coastline from the Santa Cruz harbor to the southern San Luis Obispo County line. We have been working to move California away from carbon producing energy and towards meeting our critical climate goals. It is imperative that as we transition, we ensure safety for our communities and our environment.
The Vistra BESS is located on the northern Monterey County Coast. It is surrounded by the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, critical marine educational and research facilities, important agricultural lands, residences, and businesses. The BESS also sits next to the Highway 1 corridor, and is just miles from tourist destinations that bring tens of millions of dollars to the California economy, such as the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, Pebble Beach, and Big Sur. We must protect these sensitive and valuable assets within our community.
The January 2025 fire is the fourth BESS safety incident at Moss Landing since 2019. It is the third safety incident on the Vistra property, and the second time Highway 1 has been closed due to a Moss Landing BESS fire. We are deeply concerned for the health and welfare of local residents, businesses, visitors, first responders, wildlife, and environmentally sensitive habitat that surround the Moss Landing Power Plant.
We ask that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC):
California must never have a disaster like this again. Vistra and its vendors should cooperate with any and all state investigations by sharing their data and allowing access to the site. Additionally, the Vistra BESS at Moss Landing should remain completely offline until the cause of the fire is determined and safety is guaranteed for our community and natural habitats.
The Moss Landing facility has represented a pivotal piece of our state’s energy future, however this disastrous fire has undermined the public's trust in utility scale lithium-ion battery energy storage systems. If we are to ensure California moves its climate and energy goals forward, we must demonstrate a steadfast commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, transparency, accountability, and emergency prevention.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
Dawn Addis Assemblymember, District 30
Gail Pellerin Assemblymember, District 28
John Laird State Senator, District 17

""While we urgently need climate solutions, they must be safe for our communities and environment. With that in mind, I am calling on Vistra to end its plans for a battery energy storage facility in Morro Bay and urging the California Energy Commission and the California Coastal Commission to reject their permitting application under AB 205.

We all deserve solutions that prioritize safety and sustainability.""

Dawn Addis,Governor Signs Addis Bills on Education & Coastal Protections,2024-07-19,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Legislation authored Assemblymember Dawn Addis was signed into law by California Governor Newsom this week. The two bills, AB 2173 and AB 2197, will tackle equity issues for students with disabilities and expand state coastal protection programs.
""I am thrilled that Governor Newsom has signed two of my bills,"" said Addis. ""As a teacher and life-long coastal resident, fighting for equity for students with disabilities and protecting our coast have always been my priorities. Together, the Reducing Stigma in Education Act (AB 2173) and the Protect Our Coast and Oceans Act (AB 2197) will now help create a better California for all.""
AB 2173 allows the term 'emotional disability' to replace 'emotional disturbance' for educational purposes. By making this change, individuals in public education will now be able to use a much more appropriate term, without worrying about potential legal repercussions from using language that does not conform to existing California code or regulations.
AB 2197 extends the operative date for the Protect Our Coast and Oceans voluntary tax contribution fund at the California Coastal Commission, which connects the public to California's coast and watersheds through experiential education, stewardship, and outdoor experiences.
Both bills will become law January 1, 2025.

Dawn Addis,"Addis, Chair of Central Coast Caucus, Applauds Climate Bond Act of 2024",2024-07-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO– Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), Chair of the California Central Coast Legislative Caucus, issued the following statement on Senate Bill 867, the Climate Bond Act of 2024, which was passed and signed today.
""After months of hard work and thorough discussions with the Administration, stakeholders, and communities, I am thrilled by the passage of the Climate Bond Act of 2024.
""Climate change is an ever-evolving issue that affects people worldwide. California has seen large increase in extreme weather events such as storms, heatwaves, and droughts leading to floods, wildfires, and landslides. The Central Coast was particularly impacted by last year’s winter storms and other natural disasters, which have forced thousands of residents to evacuate and caused many more homes and businesses to lose power.
""Given the need for improved, climate-resilient infrastructure, I applaud the California Legislature and the Administration for passing a strong and robust climate act that will support safe drinking water, sustainable agriculture and biodiversity, flood protection and wildfire resilience, coastal protection, and extreme heat and community resilience.""
SB 867 (Allen), the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024, authorizes a $10 billion bond to be placed before the state’s voters for approval in November 2024.
Formed in 2023, the Central Coast Legislative Caucus includes representation from the following counties: Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The caucus identifies and prioritizes issues important to the region for caucus advocacy before the state and federal government, including in the state budget process.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.

Dawn Addis,Addis on SAFETY Act & Protecting LGBTQ+ Students,2024-06-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO— Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) released the followed statement on AB 1955 (Ward), the Support Academic Futures & Educators for Today's Youth Act (SAFETY Act):
""I proudly support AB 1955, the SAFETY Act, a California LGBTQ Caucus Priority Bill. Let me clear- as a teacher for over twenty years, working with thousands of children- I can say that there is nothing wrong with being transgender, non-binary, or questioning. All children - not just some children - deserve to be who they are. Kids learn better when they feel safe. Teachers teach better and create safer environments when they have knowledge and resources founded in strong pedagogy, and are able to use their expertise. AB 1955 accomplishes all of these things.
""I'm proud to stand with my LGBTQIA+ colleagues in voting for AB 1955.""
AB 1955 would strengthen existing California protections against forced outings of LGBTQ+ students in schools and provide critical resources for parents and families of LGBTQ+ students.

Dawn Addis,Addis Honors Kate Daniels on Holocaust Remembrance Day,2024-05-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – As part of the California Legislature commemoration ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day – or Yom HaShoah – this week, Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) recognized Monterey County District 5 Supervisor-Elect Kate Daniels, granddaughter of Holocaust survivor Renate Ricci Abelmann.
""Like so many in this chamber, Renate's granddaughter Kate has taken the generational wounds of the Holocaust and made change."" Addis said of the legislative ceremony. ""As we commemorate Yom HaShoah may we remember the 6 million Jews whose lives were taken and also celebrate and honor the strength, resilience, and love of those who survived.""
""My grandmother Renate Abelmann Ricci grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, an advanced and modern society that devolved and unraveled around her when ""othering"" and hate got out of hand,"" said Daniels. ""From my grandmother's story and the stories I learned from her small community of German Jewish refugees in Los Angeles, I was taught not only our human capacity for goodness and love but our capacity for unspeakable and horrible acts of hate.
""Yom HaShoah is an important day of remembrance because this crucial piece of history is often forgotten; as well, today many people in our country question whether histories like my grandmother's even exist. It was an honor to be recognized by Assemblymember Addis and members of the Jewish Caucus. My grandmother would have been surprised and proud.""
Kate Daniels counts academic accomplishments from Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University, and has recently been elected as Monterey County's 5th District Supervisor. This week, she was recognized on the floor of the California State Assembly during its commemoration ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Dawn Addis,Bill to Protect Residents from Oil and Gas Pollution Passes Committee,2024-04-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO—A bill by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) that safeguards local governments' authority to protect residents from oil and gas pollution secured approval in its first policy hearing.

Dawn Addis,Addis Bill on Ratepayer Transparency Passes First Committee,2024-04-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO—A new bill by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) to address soaring utility rates by increasing transparency to consumers successfully passed its first committee today.
The legislation, Assembly Bill 2847, passed out of the Assembly Utilities and Energy Committee with bipartisan support.
""It's no secret that energy rates are skyrocketing - impacting real people across California,"" said Addis. ""In just three years, residential electricity rates have increased 63% for PG&E customers and 52% for SoCal Edison customers. Californians deserve to know what to expect when they open their monthly energy bills and that all of the costs included in their bills are fair and reasonable. Having this critical information will ultimately help lower costs for rate-payers.""
Specifically, AB 2847 will create new disclosure requirements for electric and gas utilities when they seek approval for long-term capital spending, requiring the full cost to ratepayers to be disclosed during the initial review of the project. This will allow the California Public Utilities Commission and ratepayers to more accurately assess whether any proposal to burden ratepayers with long-term debt outweighs the full cost of imposing the debt, and whether rate increases are reasonable and appropriate.
Addis has prioritized lowering the cost of utilities to ratepayers. Last July, Assemblymember Addis urged the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to reject excessively high fixed utility rates proposed by investor owned utilities. She has since urged the PUC to reject Pacific Gas and Electric Company's request for interim rate relief, in order to prevent additional rate increases for Californians.
AB 2847 is Addis' latest proposal to help increase protections and make utilities affordable to Californians.
AB 2847 now moves to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.

Dawn Addis,Addis Tackles Gender Violence with Legislation for Survivors,2024-04-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO—Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) joined elected officials, including Assemblymember Mike Fong, Chair of Assembly Higher Education Committee, and Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis to announce their legislative package that tackles sex discrimination and harassment in California's higher education institutions.
Assembly Bill (AB) 1905, introduced by Addis, is one of the twelve endorsed bills aimed at enhancing Title IX by addressing retreat policies on campuses.
""For too long students, faculty, and staff who have experienced the unimaginable have struggled to be heard while perpetrators have been rewarded. It's time for change,"" said Addis. ""AB 1905, the Retreat Rights Reform Act, will right these wrongs. Under this new law, those who have committed acts of sexual harassment will no longer be granted retreat rights and/or positive letters of recommendation.""
As a former educator and advocate for women's rights, Addis has made sexual harassment and violence prevention one of her top legislative priorities. Last year, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Addis' legislation, AB 452, titled the Justice for Survivors of Child Sexual Assault Act. Effective January 1, 2024, this new law removes the civil statute of limitations for survivors who experience child sexual assault.
Since January, Addis has introduced four new bills to address numerous issues for survivors, particularly children and students. In addition to AB 1905, her survivor-focused legislation includes the following:
""Since taking office, I've dedicated myself to empowering survivors and equipping them with the legal tools to pursue justice. I am proud that a significant portion of my legislative work has focused on combating gender violence and creating safe environments, especially for our students.""
These bills have garnered broad support from schools, labor unions, student advocates, parents, and law enforcement. Currently in the State Assembly, they are pending legislative hearings in their respective committees.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.

Dawn Addis,Addis Issues Statement on Highway 1 Rocky Creek Collapse,2024-04-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) issued the following statement in response to the collapse of Highway 1 south of the Rocky Creek Bridge at Palo Colorado, which stranded an estimated 1,600 people:
""Big Sur is an important region both for its unrivaled beauty and for its economic contributions to the California economy. Residents don't just make Big Sur their home, they provide important services and supports to visitors year-round.
""Our changing climate has exacerbated the danger that coastal communities' face. Since receiving reports of the Rocky Creek slide from concerned residents on Saturday, my team and I have been tirelessly dedicated to addressing the situation. I remain in direct contact with local, state, and federal partners to ensure visitors and residents are safe, able to access supplies, and when needed, leave the area.
""This incident is yet, another example of the vulnerability our coastal communities face. Chairing the Central Coast Caucus, my colleagues and I remain steadfast in advocating for critical funding for coastal resiliency, infrastructure, and emergency preparedness. It is vital for California coastal communities to have the resources they need to meet the challenges of climate change head on. I strongly encourage individuals requiring state assistance to contact our office promptly. We remain fully accessible for any assistance required.""
Starting today, convoys are anticipated to evacuate residents and move essential workers for the next several days. Convoys will be available at 8am and 4pm from Rocky Creek Bridge.

Dawn Addis,Central Coast Legislative Caucus Announces 2024 Bill Package,2024-03-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO— The California Central Coast Caucus, chaired by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), unveiled its bill priorities for the 2024 legislative session.
""This first-ever California Legislative Central Coast Caucus (CLCCC) Bill Package meets California's needs while reflecting Central Coast values"", Addis said. ""Our package reflects a diverse set of issues important to our region, and all of California. These include protecting our oceans and natural world, creating accountability for the oil industry, improving emergency planning, reducing plastics, and ensuring fair elections. The CLCCC is proud to offer a bill package that will move the needle for our region while improving the well-being of countless communities across California.""
The legislative package is comprised of ten bill priorities each poised to address critical issues facing the region:
AB 1407 (Addis) accelerates California's marine habitat restoration efforts by establishing recovery goals for critical ocean ecosystems and a state structure to develop and support restoration projects.
AB 2537 (Addis) establishes the Local and Tribal Communities Offshore Wind Capacity Building Fund. This bill will enhance the ability of local communities and tribes to actively participate in the offshore wind development process.
AB 2079 (Bennett) ensures that well permitting agencies and groundwater sustainability agencies comply with the Governor's Executive Orders on groundwater well permitting-aligning land use planning, well permitting, and groundwater management and use.
AB 2648 (Bennett) phases out California's contracts to purchase single-use plastic bottles.
AB 1866 (Hart) addresses the ongoing climate and public health crisis of idle oil wells. The bill requires oil operators to develop a comprehensive plan to expeditiously plug the estimated 40,000 idle oil wells in California within the next decade.
AB 2298 (Hart) creates the California Blue Whales and Blue Skies Program, a voluntary vessel speed reduction program to incentivize ocean-going vessels to reduce their speed.
SB 977 (Laird) establishes the San Luis Obispo Independent Redistricting Commission.
SB 1101 (Limόn) launches a planning process to identify boundaries for managing wildfire and implement prescribed fire projects more quickly.
SB 1135 (Limόn) provides a tax credit for California farmers, ranchers, and landowners who employ farming practices that maximize carbon sequestration on natural and working lands.
AB 2103 (Pellerin) speeds up the land acquisition process and permanently protects lands for conservation, cultural, or recreational purposes for the Big Basin Redwoods, Año Nuevo, and Butano State Parks.
Further updates on the progress of these bills are anticipated as they move through the legislative process in the State Assembly and State Senate.
Formed in 2023, the Central Coast Legislative Caucus includes representation from the following counties: Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. The caucus identifies and prioritizes issues important to the region for caucus advocacy before the state and federal government, including in the state budget process.

Dawn Addis,Addis Bill to Amplify Community Choice on Oil & Gas,2024-03-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO— Assembly Bill 3233, the latest bill introduced by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), aims to restore the right of local communities to make critical decisions surrounding their welfare, health, and economy.
The Local Environmental Choice and Safety Act (LECSA) clarifies local governments' authority to limit or prohibit oil and gas operations, methods, and locations within their jurisdiction.
""Pollution from oil and gas production causes grave harm to our health, climate, and environment,"" said Addis. ""For more than a century, cities and counties have protected their residents' health and safety by deciding whether, where, and under what conditions to allow oil and gas projects to operate. As California transitions away from its dependency on fossil fuels, more cities and counties have introduced ordinances to ban oil and gas operations. Assembly Bill 3233 uplifts the voices of our local communities by codifying their right to enact these policies.""
In recent years, communities such as Monterey, San Benito, and Los Angeles have attempted to limit oil activities. In 2023, the California Supreme Court overturned one of these local initiative ordinances in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. County of Monterey. If enacted, AB 3233 would uphold such policies by clarifying state and local authority.
AB 3233 is sponsored by the Center for Biological Diversity and is supported by a diverse coalition of environmental, health, and community advocates.
""This bill is vital to defending local governments' authority to protect their residents and the environment from deadly oil and gas pollution,"" said Jason Pfeifle of the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Local governments' most basic responsibility is to safeguard community health and safety. But they can't fight pollution or climate change if they don't have the full range of tools to address oil and gas projects in their own backyards.""
AB 3233 currently awaits its first hearing in the Assembly Natural Resources Committee.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties.

Dawn Addis,Central Coast Caucus Releases 2024 Budget Priorities,2024-03-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — The California Central Coast Legislative Caucus, Chaired by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced its budget priorities for the 2024-2025 fiscal year. The priorities include investments that bolster the economy, environment, and well-being of the Central Coast.
""California's Central Coast plays a fundamental role in the world's fifth largest economy,"" said Addis. ""Industries such as clean technology, innovation, agriculture, and our educational institutions significantly contribute to an economic impact of over $12 billion.

""As a representative of the Central Coast it is critical that we invest in issues like emergency preparedness, wildfire and flood mitigation, climate and coastal resiliency and more. I look forward to working alongside Assemblymember Addis, to advocate for our central coast communities in the state budget and beyond.""
Formed in 2023, the Central Coast Legislative Caucus includes representation from the following counties: Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.

Dawn Addis,Legislators Urge the PUC to Reject Proposed Utility Rate Increase,2024-03-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) urged the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to reject Pacific Gas and Electric Company's request for interim rate relief, in order to prevent additional rate increases for Californians. The request is currently under review by the CPUC.
Addis, joined by Assemblymembers Bauer-Kahan, Connolly, Pellerin, Muratsuchi and Senator Wiener, sent the following letter to Alice Busching Reynolds, the President of the California Public Utilities Commission:
Alice Busching Reynolds, President California Public Utilities Commission 505 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102
Dear President Reynolds:
We are writing to urge the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to reject the Proposed Decision on Application 23-06-008, which would grant Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (PG&E) request for interim rate relief and allow them to recover an additional $516 million from ratepayers.
In November, the CPUC approved PG&E's 2023-2026 General Rate Case (GRC), which allowed the utility to begin charging 13% more for power at the beginning of this year. This is expected to cost the average family $34.50 more per month, or $414 more per year. Combined with the increasing cost of living in the state, many California ratepayers are struggling to afford this additional burden on their monthly budget.
Now, only a few months later, PG&E is seeking to recover millions more from taxpayers by raising rates once again. If the proposed decision is approved, electric bills are expected to increase an additional $15 per month for the average customer. On top of these requests, PG&E is expected to seek to increase rates even further in the coming months, with more requests to recover costs from ratepayers pending before the commission.
This situation is untenable for many of PG&E's residential customers, who have seen rates balloon by over 80% over the last three years, making PG&E the most expensive power provider in the state. Although some of the utility's lowest-income customers may be able to access discounts, skyrocketing rates have made electric bills burdensome for customers of all income brackets, including middle class customers who will receive no rate relief.
PG&E's move to recover millions more dollars from ratepayers is particularly troubling in light of the fact that the utility recently announced $2.2 billion in profits in 2023, an increase of nearly 25% from 2022. The company also resumed issuing stockholder dividends this year.
California ratepayers are already grappling with some of the highest electricity rates in the nation. It is unconscionable for PG&E to place this additional burden on their ratepayers when they are touting billions of dollars in profits and issuing dividends that will line the pockets of their shareholders. PG&E shareholders should not be making a profit at the expense of hardworking Californians.
As California's regulator of investor-owned utilities, it is imperative that the CPUC protect the interest of the state's consumers and ensure that electricity rates are affordable for all Californians. We therefore urge the commission to reject PG&E's unreasonable request to recover millions more dollars from ratepayers.
Sincerely,

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Education Accessibility Bills,2024-02-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced a set of bills aimed at lowering barriers to education for students with disabilities in early learning and TK-12 education.
""As Chair of the Select Committee on Serving Students with Disabilities, I am committed to making California's education system effective, equitable, and affirming for each and every student,"" said Addis. ""AB 2173 and AB 2206 open doors and create commonsense solutions to problems in special education.""
AB 2173, the Reducing Stigma in Education Act, replaces the term ""emotional disturbance"" with ""emotional disability"" as it relates to California's usage of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The current ""emotional disturbance"" label inappropriately classifies children who have a non-intellectual, sensory, or physical disability. AB 2173 is sponsored by the Special Education Local Plan Areas (SELPA).
""The time has come to move away from this kind of outdated terminology that serves to further isolate and stigmatize students already working through serious social and emotional challenges,"" said Elizabeth Engelken, Chair of SELPA Administrators of California.
AB 2206, the Childcare Accessibility Act, removes a key barrier that prevents childcare providers from enrolling children with disabilities into their programs. Current state regulations have been interpreted to require a revised fire clearance for each new child with a disability, creating unnecessary barriers to childcare for these children and their families. AB 2206 removes this regulatory barrier while maintaining safety standards for children and childcare providers.
AB 2206 is co-sponsored by the Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and Monterey County Superintendents.
""It is imperative that we address the unique needs of all children, regardless of their abilities,"" said Deneen Guss, Monterey County Superintendent of Schools. ""Assemblymember Addis's proposed legislation, AB 2206, is a crucial step towards expanding the array of childcare choices available to families with children facing unique challenges.""
AB 2173 and AB 2206 now await their first policy committee hearings.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes large portions of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties and the south-eastern area of Santa Cruz County.

Dawn Addis,Addis Bill Aims to Bolster Emergency Preparedness,2024-02-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced a bill that will require mobilehome parks to have more comprehensive preparedness plans to protect vulnerable Californians during emergencies.
Assembly Bill 2022, known as the Mobilehome Emergency Preparedness Act, additionally requires mobilehome parks to make this information easily accessible to all residents.
In recent years, California has grappled with devastating natural disasters, including wildfires and flooding. Beginning in December 2022, the state experienced severe winter storms, prompting emergency declarations from both the state and federal government. The Central Coast was hit particularly hard – Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Luis Obispo counties were all deemed major disaster areas by President Biden.
""When I was first sworn into the Assembly, our communities faced unprecedented storms, including devastating damage and loss of life. This was especially the case for residents in mobilehome parks and those living in high risk flood areas. AB 2022 is an essential, preventative measure to ensure that our communities and neighbors can react, respond, and find safety during emergencies.""
AB 2022 is sponsored by the Golden State Manufactured-Homeowners League and the Legal Aid Network.
""We applaud Assemblymember Dawn Addis for taking on this issue,"" said Kendall Jarvis, the Lead Disaster Relief Attorney for Legal Aid of Sonoma County. ""This bill will address specific risks faced by mobile and manufactured home park residents by requiring parks to have working fire hydrants, access to entrance and exit points for evacuation and resident access to gas shut off valves during an emergency. Legal Aid supports this legislation and truly believes it will help save lives moving forward.""
This bill now awaits referral to a committee in the State Assembly.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes large portions of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties and the south-eastern area of Santa Cruz County.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces the Student Privacy Protection Act,2024-01-31,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced Assembly Bill 1971, the Student Privacy Protection Act.
""There is a clear and concerning lack of protections for California's students when it comes to their data privacy"" said Addis. ""Advances like those in artificial intelligence have surpassed our state's privacy laws-leaving our students vulnerable to irresponsible uses of their personal data. As technology continues to progress, so should the protections provided to Californians.""
The Student Online Personal Information Act (SOPIPA), established in 2014, prohibits organizations that deal primarily with K-12 education data from selling student data or using a student's information to amass a personal profile. SOPIPA was a groundbreaking piece of legislation that provided unprecedented protections to students across California, but requires modernization to keep up with exponential growth in the technology sector.
AB 1971 adds education-adjacent institutions, including those that assemble and administer standardized tests, into the existing list of organizations that must abide by SOPIPA. Many of these entities deal almost exclusively with K-12 education data and, under AB 1971, will be held to the same standard of privacy.
AB 1971 now awaits referral to policy committee.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes large portions of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties and the south-eastern area of Santa Cruz County.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Bill to Increase Grant Opportunities for Students with Disabilities,2024-01-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced Assembly Bill 1885, the College Access for Students with Disabilities Act, a bill that will allow students with disabilities to receive grant money for college.
""I'm authoring the College Access for Students with Disabilities Act because this bill will level the playing field and support community college students with disabilities to achieve their academic goals,"" said Addis. ""Assembly Bill 1885 will make sure that eligible students with disabilities have equitable opportunities to qualify for the Student Success Completion Grant. Doing so will increase the opportunity for needed financial support for thousands of community college students.""
Assembly Bill 1885 expands the minimum unit requirement to include students who are considered ""full-time"" at 9 units as a result of their accommodation plan from Disabled Students Programs and Services. This will allow at least 5,400 more students to be eligible to earn the grant, making college more affordable and accessible to those with disabilities.
""AB 1885 is a critical step to ensuring equitable access to financial aid to students with disabilities,"" said Dr. Sonya Christian, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges. ""AB 1885 represents what is possible when we align with policies and structures in service of student success. We thank Assemblymember Addis for championing this vital legislation.""

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces the California Mushroom Act,2024-01-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced Assembly Bill 1833, the California-Grown Mushroom Act. 
“California is the second largest mushroom producer in the world,” said Addis. “It's vital that mushroom consumers are provided transparency and that California’s farmers are recognized. My bill AB 1833 will create marketplace transparency and recognition via a labeling system that lets consumers know if their mushrooms are produced right here in the Golden State. I’m proud to author this important bill that will create the first-ever grown in California label for California’s mushroom industry.”
AB 1833 tackles misleading marketing practices for mushroom products by creating a “California Grown” designation. Its sponsors include the California Certified Organic Farmers and Far West Fungi, a family-run business. 
“California farmers face some of the highest production costs in the world,” said Erin Raser, Operations Manager at Far West Fungi. “This bill would increase transparency for California consumers that want to support local farms and give farmers a marketing tool to distinguish their product.”
AB 1833 now awaits referral to policy committee.

“The wine industry is integral to the economic success of the Central Coast and all of California,” said Addis. “I'm excited to author AB 1861 that extends a crucial line of defense for our wine industry against invasive disease. We have a track record of collaboration among state, local, federal government and the industry itself when it comes to battling Pierce’s Disease and the Glassy Winged Sharpshooter. I’m proud to extend this collaboration and to be part of the on-going success of California’s wine regions.”
Assembly Bill 1861, sponsored by California Association of Winegrape Growers and Wine Institute, addresses the spread of disease at vineyards and wineries by strengthening the Pierce’s Disease Control Program at the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
“AB 1861 will extend critical research, innovation, and mitigation efforts to safeguard the health and vitality of our crops against this invasive species,” said Robert P. Koch, president and CEO of the Wine Institute. “Assemblymember Addis’ determination and the California legislature’s support are key to eradicating this threat so the state’s winegrape growing industry can thrive.

Dawn Addis,Addis Urges NOAA to Expand Proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary,2023-10-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) sent the following letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in support of the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. In the letter, Addis urged NOAA to forgo the agency-preferred alternative that excludes ocean waters off Morro Bay and Cayucos from protection in favor of a sanctuary that unifies the entire ocean area off the Central Coast. Addis submitted her letter to NOAA before the end of the comment period on October 25, 2023.
The text of the letter is below.
October 17, 2023
Mr. Paul Michel West Coast Region Policy Coordinator NOAA Sanctuaries West Coast Regional Office 99 Pacific Street, Building 100F Monterey, CA 93940
Subject: Support for Designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary Including the Waters off of Morro Bay and Cayucos
Dear Mr. Michel,
As the California State Assemblymember representing the 30th Assembly District, which runs along 200 miles of California's coast and includes the oceans off of San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Cruz counties, I offer my strong support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Protecting ocean health off of California's coast is urgent, and our approach must be comprehensive - including both conservation and climate action. Therefore, I applaud NOAA's proposed expansion to the south along the Gaviota coast. However, I urge you to forgo the proposed exclusion of ecologically and culturally rich ocean and coastline areas of Morro Bay and Cayucos that would leave those areas unprotected.
Morro Bay is my home. It's where my husband and I raised two children. It's where I taught in public schools and served on the city council. First peoples who see the ocean as sacred have lived here for millennia. Additionally Morro Bay is a fishing village and a place where hundreds of thousands of people visit every year for its natural beauty. Our economy is dependent on the ocean and its sea life. Our collective ability to thrive hinges on our ocean's health.
Like many people, my perspective and inspiration come from where my home is. It's why I ran for office and why I serve on the California Ocean Protection Council. It's why I founded the Central Coast Legislative Caucus - to protect, promote, and celebrate what makes my home and the entire Central Coast special. Therefore, I strongly urge you to include the protection of the vital Pacific waters off of Morro Bay and Cayucos, along with the vast array of marine life and sacred places like Morro Rock, in the sanctuary boundary. Doing so will recognize the ecological and cultural significance of this ocean area and its importance to the people who live here.
NOAA has stated that the Agency-Preferred Alternative sanctuary boundary excludes areas off of the coast of Morro Bay and Cayucos due to potential conflicts with offshore wind energy infrastructure needs. Fundamentally we must both protect and preserve our oceans while combating the climate crisis - a crisis that is causing a rise in ocean temperatures and subsequent loss of sea life, feeding grounds, and hospitable habitat. The critical work necessary to achieve these goals is a part of the same mission. While I applaud NOAA's attempt to work collaboratively, the proposed exclusion is neither the only, nor the desired, approach. In fact, prior sanctuary designations show us that there are pathways for multiple critical uses within sanctuary boundaries. Therefore, I urge NOAA to take expansive, creative and bold action to craft a unified sanctuary that encompasses the entire Central Coast ocean area.
Sincerely,
Dawn Addis Assemblymember, 30th District

Dawn Addis,Governor Signs Addis Bill to Protect Mobilehome Residents,2023-10-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Legislation by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) that enshrines tenant protections for mobilehome residents was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom today. Once enacted, Assembly Bill 318 will extend the much-needed Mobilehome Residency Law Protection Program for an additional three years.
""I'm proud that the Governor doubled down on California's commitment to a critical and popular program for residents who have encountered violations in their parks,"" Addis said. ""AB 318 will allow this program to move forward so a vulnerable and often-ignored population of Californians keeps their right to seek justice.""
In 2018, California established the Mobilehome Residency Law Protection Program (MRLPP), a complaints and oversight process to safeguard vulnerable mobilehome homeowners. The newest updates to the program under AB 318 will increase the number of residents the state can assist, including seniors, working families, veterans, and other community members on fixed incomes.
AB 318 will take effect on January 1, 2024.

Dawn Addis,Governor Signs Addis Bill to Improve Funding Options for Senior Housing,2023-10-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Legislation authored by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D- Morro Bay) to allow residential care facilities for seniors to access critical tax- exempt funding was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom today. Assembly Bill 839 – known as the Residential Care Facilities Grant Act – allows these facilities to access this funding through an affordable housing program known as the California Health Facilities Financing Authority.
“I’m grateful that Governor Newsom signed AB 839 in recognition that California’s senior community is growing rapidly and in need of quality, affordable care and housing,” Addis said. “This important legislation helps California fulfill its responsibility to care for our seniors by providing the kinds of housing we need now and into the future.”
The California Health Facilities Financing Authority was established in 1979 to provide financial assistance to public and non-profit health care providers, funded by the issuance of tax-exempt bonds. AB 839 adds residential care facilities for the elderly into the existing pool of eligible fund recipients, reducing borrowing costs for these essential care providers.
AB 839 will become law on January 1, 2024.

Dawn Addis,Governor Signs Addis' Justice for Survivors Act,2023-10-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Legislation by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) and Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) to end California's arbitrary civil statute of limitations for minors who have experienced sexual abuse was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom today. With the enactment of Assembly Bill 452, California joins numerous states and the federal government in reforming its laws on child sexual assault.
""I'm grateful to Governor Newsom for his steadfast commitment to justice for survivors of child sexual assault,"" Addis said. ""With the Governor's signing of AB 452, California has removed cruel and arbitrary barriers to healing and justice. While there is much more work to do, California has taken a critical step forward in letting survivors know that their voices matter regardless of when they come forward.""
AB 452 – introduced jointly with Skinner – eliminates the time limit for the recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault for civil actions that arise on or after January 1, 2024. Specifically, the bill applies to claims in which the childhood sexual assault occurred on or after that date.
""With the shame and secrecy that surround most incidents of childhood sexual assault and abuse, it can take decades for many survivors to confront their experience. Processing trauma and painful memories is complex and can't be put on a timetable. That's why I was proud to co-author AB 452 with Assemblymember Addis to end California's arbitrary time limit for when survivors of childhood sexual assault can seek justice in court,"" said Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley. ""With Governor Newsom's signing of AB 452, going forward, children who suffer abuse will have no time limit for when they can hold to account those who abuse them and those who aid or allow the abuse to happen or cover it up.""
AB 452 will become law on January 1, 2024.

Dawn Addis,Governor Signs Addis Bill to Uplift Multilingual Learners,2023-10-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO -- Assembly Bill 370, authored by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D- Morro Bay), was signed into law today by California Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 370, also known as the Biliteracy Advancement Act, creates parity in the standards required to obtain the State Seal of Biliteracy.
""The State Seal of Biliteracy is an important way for California to recognize the high achievement of multi-lingual learners. Students of all language backgrounds who meet high levels of achievement in English and an additional language should have equitable opportunities to earn the State Seal of Biliteracy,"" Addis said. ""I appreciate the Governor's commitment to uplifting California's multilingual learners by providing all student with expanded yet rigorous opportunities to achieve the Seal.""
Due to existing disparities in the State Seal of Biliteracy criteria, English language learners are placed at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to earning the Seal. The Biliteracy Advancement Act provides students with more options when testing for English proficiency, creating parity with the current second language testing alternatives and a fair path towards the State Seal of Biliteracy for all students. The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2024.
The State Seal of Biliteracy allows for students to showcase their proficiency in multiple languages to potential colleges and employers, as well as giving students a sense of pride in their primary language. AB 370 expands the existing options that students have to prove their proficiency, without sacrificing the rigor required to obtain the State Seal of Biliteracy.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes large portions of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties and the south-eastern area of Santa Cruz County.

Dawn Addis,Addis Bills Win Legislative Approval; Now Move to Governor's Desk,2023-09-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today announced that seven of her bills have passed the State Legislature and six are on Governor Gavin Newsom's desk for his consideration. Addis bills that won legislative approval include legislation to help build student and senior housing and legislation to help survivors of childhood sexual abuse.
""I'm incredibly honored to work on behalf of the people of the Central Coast to pass these important measures,"" Addis said. ""This legislation will help the most vulnerable among us – including children and seniors. While I'm proud that we've made progress this year, there's more we must and will do to continue to improve our Central Coast communities.""
Addis bills that await consideration by Governor Newsom include:
AB 452: Justice for Survivors of Child Sex Abuse – Removes barriers that prevent minors who have experienced sexual abuse from seeking justice against their abusers and the institutions that concealed or ignored their claims.
AB 839: Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly – Expands funding eligibility for Residential Care Facilities to reduce borrowing costs and support affordable, senior living communities.
AB 318: Mobilehomes Residency Law Protection Program – Extends the much- needed Mobilehome Residency Law Protection Program, thereby allowing a vulnerable and often ignored population of Californians their right to seek justice.
AB 370: Biliteracy Advancement Act – Allows flexibility for English learners to demonstrate their multi-lingual competency when applying for the State Seal of Biliteracy.
AB 1123: Paid Parental Leave Act – Enables CSU employees to take an academic term of paid parental/family leave.
AB 840: CSU Tied-House Exemption Program – Widens sponsorship opportunities for small businesses and CSU campuses (including those at Cal Poly and CSUMB) which will help support various campus programs.
In July, Governor Newsom signed Addis' AB 358, which streamlines the approval of new community college student housing by exempting architectural plans from specified state approvals. AB 358 will go into effect on January 1, 2024.
Thursday, September 14 marks the final day of the first year of the 2023-24 legislative session. The Legislature will be in recess until January 2024. At that time, lawmakers can submit new legislation for consideration and continue work on bills that did not win approval by this week.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the coastal 30th Assembly District, which includes large portions of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties and the south-eastern area of Santa Cruz County.

Dawn Addis,Addis Bill to Address Childhood Sexual Assault Clears Legislature,2023-09-12,press_release,NA,"""The Justice for Survivors Act"" now goes to Governor for consideration
SACRAMENTO – Legislation by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) that will end California's arbitrary civil statute of limitations for minors who have experienced sexual abuse was approved by the State Assembly on a bipartisan basis today. The bill – Assembly Bill 452 – now goes to the desk of Governor Gavin Newsom for his consideration.
""Assembly Bill 452 sets a new standard for institutions with minors under their care – when a child or family reports abuse, do something, don't be a bystander,"" Addis said. ""This common sense legislation puts abusers and the institutions that harbor them on notice that California won't tolerate childhood sexual assault any longer.""
The bill – introduced jointly with Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) – explicitly governs future cases of sexual assault, giving institutions time to prevent future cases of child sexual assault.
Under current law, survivors who experience sexual assault as minors only have until their 40th birthday to seek justice in civil court. Assembly Bill 452 eliminates the deadline to file a civil claim for an incidence of sexual assault that arises on or after January 1, 2024.
Last year, President Joe Biden signed the Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act, which removed statute of limitations for people who were sexually abused as minors to file civil claims in federal courts. Subsequently, numerous states have eliminated the statutes at the state level.
Assembly Bill 452 now moves to the Governor for his consideration.

Dawn Addis,Addis Urges the PUC to Reject Utilities' Proposed Fixed Rates,2023-07-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today urged the California Public Utilities Commission to reject excessively high fixed utility rates proposed by investor owned utilities. The Commission is in the process of instituting a new income-based fixed rate structure after it was authorized to do so by the passage of Assembly Bill 205, a budget trailer bill signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022.
Addis sent the following letter to Alice Busching Reynolds, the President of the California Public Utilities Commission:
July 10, 2023
Alice Busching Reynolds, President California Public Utilities Commission 505 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco, CA 94102
Dear President Busching Reynolds,
I’m writing in regard to the implementation of Assembly Bill 205 by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). This legislation provides for new fixed charges for residential energy customers on an income-graduated basis.
As you know, the final version of AB 205 was introduced, approved by the Legislature and signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in the span of 96 hours in the waning days of the 2021-22 legislative session. While well-meaning, the contents of the bill are far-reaching on several fronts. The provisions that relate to
fixed energy charges will have profound impacts on residential energy customers of all income brackets. This requires additional scrutiny.
In response to the Governor's approval of AB 205, regulated utilities have submitted fixed charge proposals to the CPUC that are alarming. PG&E has offered a graduated rate schedule that would charge households that make over $180,000 a year a fixed rate of $92 per month on top of charges for electricity usage. San Diego Gas & Electric has proposed a fixed rate of $128 for this same income bracket of households.
Many customers have expressed legitimate concerns that the proposed rate schedules skew toward incredibly high charges on the middle class. There is a vast difference between a household that earns $180,000 and a household that earns $1,000,000. For example, the proposed fixed rates would treat a two- teacher household the same as a billionaire. This is clearly unfair.
I therefore urge the CPUC to reject the proposals it has received from regulated utilities and adjust rate schedules in a way that recognizes the difference between a working class household and a household of true wealth. If the CPUC does not feel that it has the latitude under the provisions of AB 205 to make such changes, I request that you provide guidance to the Legislature and the Newsom Administration about how policymakers can change the law to provide more manageable rates for a broader array of rate payers. While there are merits to an income-graduated rate system, we must spread rates in a way that does not harm the middle class.
I note that the CPUC has until July 1, 2024 to authorize these new fixed charges. There is ample time for reflection and adjustment. It's crucial that we get this right.
Please don't hesitate to contact my Chief of Staff, Jim Evans, at jim.evans@asm.ca.gov or 916-319-2030 with your feedback or questions.
Sincerely, DAWN ADDIS Assemblymember, 30th District

Dawn Addis,Addis Bills on Offshore Wind and Ocean Life Recovery Pass State Assembly,2023-05-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Two ocean/coastal protection bills by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) won approval in the State Assembly today. The two bills are:
Assembly Bill 80, which requires California to build a strong science-based monitoring program to better understand the impact of offshore wind energy on ocean life and habitat.
Assembly Bill 1407, which accelerates California's marine life restoration efforts by establishing recovery goals for critical ocean ecosystems and a state structure to develop and support restoration projects.
""California has a long history of coastal protections and addressing the climate crisis and these bills continue that tradition,"" Addis said. ""Not only should we ensure that we restore and preserve our ocean habitats for future generations, we must be mindful of these habitats and all ocean life as we take the necessary steps to build off shore wind energy off the coast of California.""
Both bills are supported by diverse coalitions and have bipartisan support. AB 80 is co-sponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis. AB 1407 is co-sponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Nature Conservancy.
""Our ocean faces so many challenges, including habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and threats posed by climate change,"" said Amy Wolfrum, Monterey Bay Aquarium California Ocean Policy Senior Manager. ""We applaud the Assembly's unanimous passage of Assemblymember Addis' vital legislation, which will support science, help protect marine wildlife and restore foundational ocean habitats.""
""The Nature Conservancy is grateful for the leadership of Assemblymember Addis on AB 1407 which takes critical steps to support the restoration of kelp forests, eelgrass meadows, and native oyster beds,"" said Liz Forsburg Pardi, Ph.D. Interim Director of External Affairs and Policy, The Nature Conservancy. ""Given dramatic declines in these key marine habitats, the value of California's ocean economy, and the continued threat of climate change, we must lend nature a helping hand to protect California's unique biodiversity and sustain our coastal communities.""
The bills now move to the State Senate, where they will be heard in policy committees there.

Dawn Addis,Addis Honors Holocaust Survivor in Assembly to Commemorate Yom Hashoah,2023-04-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – As part of the California Legislature commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day – or Yom HaShoah – this week, Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) recognized San Luis Obispo County resident Paul Wolff, who survived the Holocaust by escaping Nazi Germany in 1939. Mr. Wolff joined Addis on the Assembly floor for the ceremony.
""It's so important to remember the stories of brutality and genocide of the Holocaust so we can prevent it from happening again,"" Addis said. ""At the same time, we honor those who were lost and those who survived – that's why I'm thankful that Paul Wolff could join us to share his extraordinary experiences.""
Another resident of Addis' Assembly District, Rabbi Paula Marcus – from Aptos – delivered the convocation during the Assembly ceremony at Addis' invitation.

Mr. Wolff was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1929. His father, a highly decorated German Army Officer in World War 1, was arrested on Kristallnacht in 1938 and jailed for 9 days. Kristallnacht (the Night of Broken Glass) was the day in November 1938 when Nazi leaders unleashed vandalism and destruction of Jewish-owned businesses, synagogues, and homes.
In January 1939, Mr. Wolff and his sisters were stoned on their way home from school by their schoolmates, as Jewish children were all expelled from school. The Wolffs escaped from Hamburg in April 1939, arriving in the United States, via England on August 1, 1939, 30 days before the start of World War II.
Mr. Wolff, together with his wife Marion, also a Holocaust survivor, spent much of the past 20 years speaking to students (locally and in Germany) sharing their histories of escape from Nazi Germany and connecting it with the evils of the prejudice and discrimination we see today. Since his wife's passing in 2021, Mr. Wolff continues to give these talks on his own, as he is passionate about sharing their stories so that we shall never forget.
In 1971, Mr. Wolff began his distinguished teaching career at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, developing a course entitled ""Towards a Barrier-Free Environment"" in 1979, and subsequently launching Universal Design as an integral part of the architecture department. He became a tireless advocate of Universal Access for people with disabilities, helping to start Access for All, a local community advocacy group promoting accessibility.

Dawn Addis,Addis Offshore Wind Bill Passes First Committee,2023-04-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – A bill by Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) that requires California to build a strong science-based monitoring program to better understand the impact of offshore wind energy development on ocean life and habitat passed its first committee today.
The legislation – Assembly Bill 80 – passed out of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee by a unanimous and bipartisan vote of 11-0.
It's critical that we maintain California's strong commitment to ocean and coastal protections while we build offshore wind energy,"" Addis said. ""This bill will help California follow, collect and fund scientific research on offshore wind energy in marine environments and make that research available to decision makers and the public.""
Specifically, AB 80 requires the Ocean Protection Council to create a science entity to coordinate and oversee the scientific research and monitoring that decision-makers need ahead of and during the development of offshore wind energy.
The bill is co-sponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The Assembly Natural Resources Committee voted to send AB 80 to its next stop – the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill is co-authored by Senator John Laird (D-Santa Cruz). During the committee hearing, Assemblymembers Rich Chavez Zbur (D-West Hollywood) and Gail Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz) added on as co-authors.
In December, the federal government leased five offshore wind areas along California's coast – three off the coast of San Luis Obispo County, and two off the coast of Humboldt County.

Dawn Addis,"Addis, Assembly Honor District 30 ""Woman of the Year""",2023-03-20,press_release,NA,"Francisca Arroyo Rosales of Seaside Honored by Addis
SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today announced that the California State Assembly is honoring Francisca Arroyo Rosales of Seaside as the 2023 ""Woman of the Year"" for Assembly District 30.
Ms. Arroyo Rosales is being honored for her record of civic engagement, including her work on disaster assistance for families who have been impacted by the 2023 storms, and in the Seaside community during the COVID pandemic.
""Francisca represents the best of what it means to be an engaged, selfless community member,"" Addis said. ""As a VIDA Community Health Worker in Monterey County, Francisca was on the forefront of addressing the COVID crisis, connecting Spanish speakers and undocumented people with crucial testing, vaccination, food, and financial resources. Her tireless devotion to the health and safety of Monterey's most vulnerable residents is a model for us all. I am incredibly proud to name her my first Woman of the Year.""
Ms. Arroyo Rosales will be honored today on the floor on the State Assembly along with women from other Assembly and Senate districts to recognize the historic achievements of women during Women's History Month.
Ms. Arroyo Rosales has become a staple in her Seaside community by participating in community events, volunteering her spare time to educate youth and parents, and focusing on drug prevention throughout the county.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Arroyo Rosales became a Monterey County VIDA Community Health Worker, where she became equipped to deliver information about COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. In this capacity, she was also able to help residents with access to rental and utilities relief, among other resources.
A former elementary school teacher in Mexico City, Ms. Arroyo Rosales' passion can be seen through her previous work for the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District as a former volunteer for Seaside High School's ""Gear Up"" program where she focused her time on increasing opportunities for underserved youth. Her passion allowed her to become the former PTA president at Seaside Middle School where she increased parent involvement and advocated for safer communities for youth.
In her spare time, Ms. Arroyo Rosales sponsors youth facing alcohol and substance abuse and she remains civically engaged in local government, and volunteers her time and efforts by assisting local municipalities with outreach and engagement.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Bill to Help Displaced Californians in Emergencies,2023-02-17,press_release,NA,"AB 877 Inspired by Winter Storms
SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced legislation today to create the ""Good Neighbor Tax Credit,"" a tax incentive for hotels, inns, and other entities in the hospitality sector to temporarily house displaced individuals during a declared state of emergency.
""The winter storms on the Central Coast showed us that despite the best intentions of government and civic groups, it's difficult for displaced residents to find emergency temporary housing,"" Addis said. ""The Good Neighbor Tax Credit will give hotels a tool that will help people who have suffered terrible personal losses get back on their feet.""
The legislation, Assembly Bill 877, is pending referral to a committee in the State Assembly.
In January, the state experienced severe winter storms, prompting emergency declarations from both the state and federal government. The Central Coast was hit particularly hard – Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Luis Obispo counties were all deemed major disaster areas by President Joe Biden.
The Good Neighbor Tax Credit would allow small businesses such as hotels, inns, and motels to claim a tax credit if they house victims of a natural disaster free of charge. In order to claim the credit, the establishment would need to be located in a county that was in a state of emergency, declared by either the Governor of California or the President of the United States. The credit would apply to establishments with under 50 total rooms, ensuring that small businesses are the target of this relief.
Dawn Addis was elected to the California State Assembly in 2022 to represent the 30th Assembly District. Dawn is a special education teacher who began teaching in public schools over 20 years ago, and holds a Master of Arts (MA) degree in special education from San Francisco State University.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Bill to Accelerate Marine Life Restoration,2023-02-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today introduced the Ocean Life Recovery Act to accelerate California's marine habitat restoration efforts by establishing recovery goals for critical ocean ecosystems and a state structure to develop and support restoration projects.
""California's marine ecosystems are under unprecedented threat from climate change, pollution and coastal development,"" Addis said. ""This critical legislation will set California on a path to restore our vital ocean habitats so that we can preserve these cultural and natural wonders for generations to come.""
""Improving the health of our oceans is a critical part of mitigating some of the worst impacts of climate change,"" said State Senator John Laird (D-Santa Cruz), principal co-author of the bill. ""Establishing these goals will allow us to measure progress and rehabilitate important habitat.""
""Protecting our ocean habitat must happen now before it is too late, I am happy to join Assemblymember Addis on this important legislation,"" said bill co-author Assemblymember Gail Pellerin (D-Santa Cruz). ""We have recently witnessed the damage that can be done by climate change, with the atmospheric rivers we just experienced. This is just one sobering reminder that we must act now to address climate change.""
Assembly Bill 1407 focuses on the restoration and recovery of the foundation of nearshore ecosystems – kelp, eelgrass and native oysters. This wildlife is ecologically important in marine life food systems and is home to a variety of invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals and birds. The collapse of Northern California kelp forests has been documented by University of California, Santa
Cruz researchers who found that the forest had declined by 95 percent in a 2021 study.
""With more than a 90 percent decline of key marine habitats, it's time we stand up for our oceans,"" said Jay Ziegler, Director of External Affairs & Policy, California Oceans Program, The Nature Conservancy. ""This bill is a critical first step towards aligning the state and Californians to invest the time and resources to protect California's unique biodiversity and sustain our coastal communities.""
""California has an opportunity to reverse the rapid declines we've seen in critical coastal habitats like kelp forests, eelgrass meadows, and native oyster beds,"" said Margaret Spring, Chief Conservation and Science Officer, Monterey Bay Aquarium. ""We can't lose the places that buffer communities from storms, serve as nurseries for our fisheries, and lock away the atmospheric carbon that drives climate change. It's past time for a coordinated strategy and ambitious goals to restore these ecosystems. This bill will lay that groundwork, with our state partners leading the way.""
AB 1407 adds California to the growing list of regions and states who are actively engaged in this work by establishing clear restoration targets for acres of kelp forests, eelgrass meadows, and native oyster beds restores. Moreover, AB 1407 facilitates interagency coordination to address hurdles that slow restoration efforts and creates an Ocean Restoration and Recovery Fund to support the development and execution of large-scale marine restoration and enhancement projects.

Dawn Addis,Addis Introduces Bill to Strengthen California Military Communities,2023-02-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today introduced the Stronger Defense Communities Act, a bipartisan bill to create a way for California to partner with the federal government to fund critical infrastructure in state communities that host military bases.
""California is home to thousands of military families who not only sacrifice for the betterment of our country, but also provide significant economic contributions to our state,"" Addis said. ""This bill helps California's defense communities by supporting local efforts to access federal funds for water, road and other improvements that benefit military families and the communities where they live.""
The legislation, Assembly Bill 444, is pending committee referral in the State Assembly. Senator Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh (R-Yucaipa) is the principal coauthor of the bill.
Currently, California defense communities can apply for federal infrastructure grants through the Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot (DCIP) program, a federal program that funds military-related infrastructure improvements. While the DCIP is an important tool, communities are often not able to meet the matching requirements that many of the grants require.
AB 444 would provide state assistance to these communities, providing funding to match the grant requirements under the DCIP. The bill would also support these communities in identifying potential DCIP projects through other grants. Communities often need assistance in identifying, planning, and implementing these projects when they cannot afford to do so with local funds.
By creating an avenue for military communities to access these funds, California will ensure that critical infrastructure needs are met for both the military bases and their surrounding communities.

Dawn Addis,Addis & Skinner Introduce Bill to End Civil Statute of Limitations for Child Sexual Abuse,2023-02-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) and Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), the Chair of the Legislative Women's Caucus, today introduced AB 452, the Justice for Survivors Act. The legislation ends California's arbitrary civil statute of limitations for minors who have experienced sexual abuse and removes barriers that prevent survivors from seeking justice against their abusers and the institutions that concealed or ignored their claims.
""I am immensely proud to author the Justice for Survivors Act with my colleague, Senator Skinner,"" Addis said. ""By eliminating the civil statute of limitations for child sexual abuse, we are helping survivors come forward to seek the critical closure they need. It's time to end this arbitrary and cruel time limit on justice.""
""There are good reasons why survivors of sexual assault and abuse may take years or decades to confront their experience. This delay can be due to the complex ways in which we process trauma, and for self-protection, suppress painful memories. These incidents of abuse are often accompanied by threats of harm, feelings of shame, or the very legitimate fear of not being believed,"" explained Skinner, who is a co-author of AB 452 and of prior bills on this topic. ""It's unacceptable and cruel that many California victims of childhood sex abuse are unable to hold their abusers accountable because our law now says their time has run out. AB 452 will right this wrong by eliminating the deadline for taking civil action against child abusers and those who aided or allowed the abuse to happen or covered it up.""
Under current law, survivors who experience sexual assault as minors only have until their 40th birthday to seek justice in civil court.
Last year, President Joe Biden signed the Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act, which removed statute of limitations for people who were sexually abused as minors to file civil claims in federal courts. Subsequently, numerous states have eliminated the statutes at the state level.
""There is an epidemic of child sexual abuse, with 13.5 percent of children at risk of being sexually assaulted before their 18th birthday, many repeatedly. Society must protect children through statutes of limitations reform,"" said Kathryn Robb, Executive Director of Child USAdvocacy. ""There is a national movement sweeping across the country to reform our laws, with many jurisdictions passing elimination, extension and revival legislation for child sexual abuse claims. These are not typical torts, and they demand an atypical response. Bravo to California for acting once again to protect children and honor justice.""
""This bill introduction is a monumental step forward and brings much-needed awareness to reform the archaic laws that prevent survivors from coming forward and allows abusers to escape justice and hurt others,"" said Mike McDonnell, spokesperson for SNAP, a peer network of survivors of institutional sexual abuse and their supporters. ""We are grateful to not only Assemblymember Addis and colleagues, but the dedicated survivors and advocates who have worked so hard to create this opportunity for reform.""
AB 452 now awaits referral to its first policy committee.

Dawn Addis,Addis Announces Biliteracy Advancement Act,2023-02-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) introduced Assembly Bill 370 known as the Biliteracy Advancement Act. This legislation creates fairer standards for the criteria required to obtain the State Seal of Biliteracy (SSB), specifically pertaining to English language learners.
""Obtaining the State Seal of Biliteracy should be achievable for multilingual students from all primary-language backgrounds,"" Addis said. ""Balancing this benchmark is a step in the right direction when it comes to equitable education.""
Currently, there is a distinct difference in the requirements to obtain the State Seal of Biliteracy, namely a lack of flexibility when demonstrating proficiency in English. Students have two mandatory testing criteria when demonstrating their command of the English language, without an option for substitution or flexibility, while there are five separate flexible testing options when testing for a non- English language. The lack of testing options for the English portion of SSB puts English language learners at a clear disadvantage to other students.
The Biliteracy Advancement Act would provide students with more options when testing for English proficiency, creating parity with the current second language testing alternatives and a fair path towards the State Seal of Biliteracy for all students. The SSB allows for students to showcase their proficiency in multiple languages to potential colleges and employers, as well as giving students a sense of pride in their primary language.

Dawn Addis,Addis Urges Residents To Stay Safe Amid Next Wave Of Storms,2023-01-12,press_release,NA,"Flooding anticipated for the Salinas River in Monterey County; further updates below
SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) today urged residents of Assembly District 30 (the counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz and Monterey) to stay safe amid the next wave of storms by paying close attention to the latest information from local governments and heeding the direction of first responders and other emergency personnel.
""The Central Coast is experiencing historic and devastating weather and there's more on the way,"" Addis said. ""We can't stop the rain and wind, but we can prevent further tragic deaths by being mindful of our surroundings and staying updated on the latest emergency information. Our coastal communities have come together to help neighbors and vulnerable residents. At the state level, we'll do everything possible to honor that selflessness by continuing to work with state and federal officials to bring all the resources we can to help the people of Assembly District 30.""
On Tuesday, Addis joined Governor Gavin Newsom, Secretary of Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot and Capitola and Santa Cruz County officials to survey the damage in Capitola. On January 8, the Governor submitted a request to the White House for a Presidential Emergency Declaration to support ongoing storm response and recovery efforts. Just prior to conferring with the Governor and local officials, Addis met with workers at the Pacific, Gas & Electric command center in Capitola for an update on all that the utility is doing to restore service in Santa Cruz County.
The latest news by county is as follows:
Monterey County issued a warning Wednesday that the Salinas River will be at flood stage today (Thursday). The County reports that roads affected include State Route 68, River Road, Reservation Road, Blanco Road, multiple secondary roads, and potentially Highway 1.

Find the latest information here.
While Santa Cruz County evacuation orders were lifted in Capitola, Rio Del Mar, and Soquel, there are still evacuation warnings in effect due to continued weather systems that are expected in the coming days and the potential flooding that could come with them. Find the latest information here.
According the National Weather Service, the Central Coast could see winds in the 20mph range and rainfall of up to two inches this weekend.

Dawn Addis,Addis Issues Statement on Federal Offshore Wind Auction Results,2022-12-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) issued the following statement in reaction to the final results of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) first-ever auction of five Pacific Ocean lease areas (including 3 locations directly off the central coast):
""Today's auction results demonstrate that floating offshore wind on the West Coast is both absolutely necessary to address the climate crisis, and economically viable for the companies that won today's bids. What happens next is critical. I look forward to working with our coastal communities to ensure the auction winners are true partners.""
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) lease sale began yesterday for five areas on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off central and northern California — three off San Luis Obispo County and two off the coast of Humboldt County. The winners were announced here.
Addis is the principal co-author — with Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-West Hollywood) and Assemblymember Gregg Hart (D-Santa Barbara) — of Assembly Bill 3, which states the Legislature’s intent to clarify which state entities will impact offshore wind projects and to ensure community participation and environmental protection of lands adjacent to offshore wind projects.

""While the sale of these leases is a critical and transformative step to providing clean energy to California, the development of offshore wind off the central coast will impact our communities in ways we can't fully appreciate today. In the coming years, state and regional policymakers must seriously examine how offshore wind farms affect what makes the coast great — our fisheries, public beaches, native lands and our economy, including tourism. There is no doubt that, if done right, offshore wind will be a great benefit to California's push for 100 percent clean energy and to our economy. My focus will be on ensuring that our coastal communities have a voice in the process and share in those benefits.""

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Protect Homeowners from Fraudulent ADU Builders,2025-02-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the introduction of AB 559, which will protect homeowners from fraud by limiting the amount that contractors constructing Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) can request upfront or as progress payments. Importantly, AB 559 will toughen penalties for contractors who violate these crucial consumer protections. This bill is sponsored by the Contractors State License Board (CSLB) in response to a high-profile case involving a contractor who defrauded homeowners out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and abandoned homeowners with unfinished ADUs.
“California is in the midst of a severe housing crisis, and ADUs are a critical part of the overall effort to build more housing units. Unfortunately, as demand for ADUs has grown, so too has exploitation of homeowners by unscrupulous contractors,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “AB 559 will ensure that homeowners are not scammed out of their life savings or left abandoned with unfinished ADUs. This bill responds directly to complaints from homeowners who paid contractors for ADUs that were never completed.”
“AB 559 will prevent dishonest contractors from financially harming consumers by requesting and accepting excessive payments for accessory dwelling unit construction that is incomplete or not performed. CSLB is pleased to partner with Assemblymember Berman on this bill to protect consumers,” said CSLB Registrar David Fogt.
CSLB has recently received more than 400 complaints regarding contractors failing to complete ADU construction projects and causing considerable financial harm to consumers. This has resulted in the license revocation of one high-profile company and possible disciplinary action against others. CSLB held a Legislative Committee meeting on September 18, 2024, providing a public forum to discuss enhancing consumer protection for residential construction in the Contractors State License Law. As a result of this meeting, CSLB staff identified areas in the law that can be strengthened to better protect consumers and discourage unlawful activity by contractors, which are included in AB 559.
Assemblymember Marc Berman represents the 23rd Assembly District, which includes southern San Mateo County and northern Santa Clara County in the heart of the Silicon Valley.

Marc Berman,Bills Introduced to Stop the Puppy Mill Pipeline in California,2025-02-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — In response to a groundbreaking multi-part investigation into the puppy market in California by the Los Angeles Times this fall, Senator Tom Umberg and Assemblymembers Steve Bennett and Marc Berman jointly introduced legislation this morning in Sacramento to curb consumer fraud and abuse in California. 
Standing side-by-side with colleagues, animal advocates, and puppies from Sacramento County Animal Services, the legislators all declared their commitment to ending the puppy mill pipeline in California, once and for all with the introduction of three measures, all jointly sponsored by the ASPCA (The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and San Diego Humane Society.

Senator Thomas J. Umberg (D-Santa Ana), author of Senate Bill 312, noted “As chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a rescue dog owner myself, I am appalled by what the Los Angeles Times has uncovered in its investigation into, and exposure of, extensive fraud and suffering in the puppy trade. Like many, I have been under the impression that advocacy and awareness of this issue had largely reduced or eliminated the puppy mill business in California. I’m proud to be authoring SB 312 as a part of this important package to protect consumers moving forward.”
SB 312 mandates that dog importers submit health certificates electronically to the California Department of Food & Agriculture within 10 days of shipment and requires those certificates to be made publicly available. This health certificate information is crucial for individual consumers to confirm information about their dog and is also helpful to humane law enforcement agencies as they work to investigate fraud and malfeasance.
“Choosing our fur-ever companions is a meaningful, life-changing process. Families are entitled to know where their new dog/cat comes from, and the conditions in which their pet grew up,” said Assemblymember Steve Bennett (D-Oxnard). “By requiring sellers to provide more information up front and prohibiting the use of non-refundable deposits as a “paywall,” Assembly Bill 506 will empower families in the adoption process.” 
Assemblymember Bennett’s AB 506 voids contracts between California consumers and online pet brokers that require a nonrefundable deposit and/or fail to disclose the original source of a dog or cat prior to a deposit being issued. The bill also requires sellers to return money to the buyers within 30 days if the contract is voided. 
The third bill of the Stop the Puppy Mill Pipeline is Assembly Bill 519, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, (D-Palo Alto), Chair of the Assembly Business & Professions Committee. AB 519 ends pet brokering in California by defining “brokers” as any person or business that makes a profit by selling animals bred and raised by another, and prohibits said people from selling or “adopting out” pets for a profit. 
“I was shocked to learn that bad actors are getting around California's ban on puppy mills by claiming to be local breeders, when in reality they're buying abused and neglected puppies from cruel out-of-state breeding operations and selling them to unsuspecting pet parents,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “As Chair of the Business and Professions Committee, every year I see advocates and animal lovers push for improvements to animal welfare in California. After reading the LA Times exposé, and as a dog dad myself, it was clear to me that we must do more to improve both animal welfare and consumer protection in our state. My bill will crack down on those that represent to be small, local home breeders, when they are actually importing puppies bred in puppy mills in states with inhumane animal welfare laws.”
The Times’ investigation found that “truckloads of dogs from profit-driven mass breeders pour into California every year from the Midwest, and then resold by people claiming to be small, local home breeders.” Misleading marketing tactics, predatory financial behaviors, and a gap in regulations are allowing these online brokers to take advantage of consumers and allowing puppy mills to continue to reach Californians when searching for a new companion. 
“Consumers deserve complete transparency about the flood of puppies entering our state—this is not just about protecting people from unhealthy pets, but about stopping the cruel pipeline from puppy mills,” said Dr. Gary Weitzman, president and CEO of San Diego Humane Society. “These bills are critical to closing dangerous loopholes in California’s pet sales ban, and they will help us shut down the inhumane practices that exploit animals for profit.”
“California has long been a leader in animal welfare, including being the first state to stop puppy mills from selling through their largest outlet – pet stores. Unfortunately, puppy mills shut out from the retail market still ship puppies into California using deceptive websites and middlemen,” said Brittany Benesi, senior legislative director for the ASPCA, Western division. “Together, the three bills introduced by Senator Umberg, Assemblymember Berman, and Assemblymember Bennett address the pet industry’s most deceptive tactics to prevent them from profiting off of unsuspecting consumers looking to add a new pet to their family, and expand on California’s commitment to ending the puppy mill pipeline for good.”
At a time when California shelters are overflowing with adoptable puppies, kittens, dogs and cats, SB 312, AB 506 and AB 519 will provide transparency in the sales process and protect both consumers and animals alike. All three measures will be heard in policy committees in March or April.
Fact sheets for SB 312, AB 506, and AB 519 can all be found here.
Both puppies (5 month old siblings) from this morning’s press conference are available for adoption through the Bradshaw Animal Shelter in Sacramento.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Establish Physician Health and Wellness Program,2025-02-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the introduction of AB 408 to establish a Physician Health and Wellness Program (PHWP) to help physicians with substance use disorders and other conditions receive treatment so they can continue practicing safely. 
“When our physicians struggle with substance use disorders, it is in the best interest of both patients and physicians to support them in seeking out help. That’s why I am proud to introduce AB 408, which builds off of my years of work to destigmatize seeking treatment for substance use disorders,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “This is fundamentally about patient safety. Today, physicians struggling with substance use disorders can feel pressure to hide their condition and often never get the help they need. The creation of this program will help healthcare providers get the care they need, which will better protect patients in the end.”
“On behalf of Medical Board of California, we are grateful that Assemblymember Berman is partnering with us to promote safe patient care through a physician health and wellness program. Impaired healthcare providers can cause devastating harm. This program will provide care and treatment to the Board’s current and future licensees so that they can stay healthy and provide the high-quality care that patients deserve,” said Kristina Lawson, President of the Medical Board of California. “The Board’s mission is to protect patients and, too often, we first learn about a dangerous physician after their patient has been hurt. This legislation takes a proactive approach to prevent patient harm by getting care and treatment to physicians before they become unsafe to practice medicine.”
“Physicians, like all people, experience mental health struggles, but they often try to navigate these situations on their own due to fear that seeking help will harm them professionally and prevent them from doing what they love as doctors,” said President of the California Medical Association Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “AB 408 would establish an effective, confidential program – similar to what other states have and in line with national best practices – that supports physicians’ health and wellness and protects patients by allowing physicians to be at their best.”
AB 408 sponsored by the Medical Board of California, would allow the board to establish a Physician Health and Wellness Program (PHWP) that utilizes what experts have found to be the most effective approach to helping physicians with substance use disorders and other conditions receive treatment so they can continue practicing safely. The board’s previous diversion program was found in an audit to be ineffective and was subsequently eliminated, resulting in the board having no formal program for impaired physicians for a number of years. A prior bill from 2016 authorized them to reestablish a physician health and wellness program; however, the language was later determined to be inconsistent with evidence-based best practices and the board concluded that physicians would be discouraged to participate. This bill would revise that statutory authority to allow the board to establish an effective program.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Reacts to Governor Newsom’s Budget Proposal,2025-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) issued the following statement in response to Governor Newsom’s January budget proposal: 
“I am cautiously optimistic about the news today. Revenues are up, which is a reflection of our growing economy. The tough choices we made last year have paid off—the 2025-26 Budget will likely have fewer to no significant additional cuts. Having focused on increasing access to high-demand careers like computer science and cybersecurity during my time in the legislature, I was pleased to see substantial investments in career education to make it easier for Californians to receive college credit for real-world experience. Additionally, I support the continued investments in wildfire mitigation efforts. The devastating fires in Los Angeles are a stark reminder about my district’s own wildfire vulnerability and the importance of state investment. Lastly, I applaud the Governor’s efforts to continue to improve the efficiency of our state government.” 
“While the news is positive today, we must continue to prioritize fiscal prudence. Our budget is volatile, and the incoming federal administration’s tariff policies may drive up inflation and impact California’s ports. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Governor over the next several months to negotiate and finalize a state budget that tangibly improves Californians’ lives.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws",2024-12-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) authored sixteen new laws that take effect in 2025.
“Many of the laws I authored this year seek to protect Californians from a new frontier of threats driven by the malicious use of advanced technology, including AI-driven child sexual exploitation, revenge porn, and AI-generated elections deepfakes. My work to bolster safety in our communities included passing a bill to crack down on retail theft and another to protect voters and election workers from intimidation at their polling places,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “I continued my work to strengthen our elections systems and am proud that California now has one of the most accessible, secure, and transparent voting systems in the country. 2024 marked five years in a row with no Gubernatorial vetoes—a record that reflects my focus on commonsense policy proposals and robust stakeholder engagement to ensure the best possible results for my constituents and all Californians.”
Unless otherwise stated, all laws go into effect on January 1, 2025:
Assembly Bill 1831 ensures that the sexual exploitation of children in California is illegal—including AI-generated pictures and videos of children being sexually abused. This new law will address the rapidly accelerating dangers posed by AI-generated content that is disturbing, harmful, and virtually indistinguishable from actual children.
Assembly Bill 3209 will help protect our local businesses, employees, and shoppers by creating a Retail Crime Restraining Order—a needed enforcement tool to combat organized and repeated retail theft. 
Assembly Bill 1962 was brought to me by Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen after a local victim of revenge porn was left without justice due to a glaring legal loophole. This law closes this loophole, strengthens our revenge porn laws, and ensures consequences for individuals who distribute secretly recorded private sexual images of another person without their consent.
Assembly Bill 2655, the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act, protects the integrity of our elections by removing the most malicious deepfake audio or visual media that falsely portray the actions or words of a candidate or elected official in the lead up to an election. 
Assembly Bill 2642, the PEACE Act, is a first-in-the-nation law to protect voters and election workers by keeping guns out of our polling places. Increasingly violent rhetoric and election conspiracy theories have led to threats of intimidation at polling places and an exodus of election workers, which threatens to undermine our democracy.The new law, which took effect in September 2024, provides explicit civil protections for election worker and voters facing intimidation, threats, or coercion. 
Assembly Bill 3184, which took effect in September 2024, expands opportunities for voters to ensure that their vote will count by simplifying forms and temporarily extending the time and a uniform deadline for voters to fix a missing or mismatching signature on a vote by mail ballot envelope.
Assembly Bill 2127 continues oversight of DMV to ensure implementation of our New Motor Voter law easily allows Californians to register to vote or update their voter registration when they obtain or renew their driver’s license.
Assembly Bill 3158 provides free college for every West Valley-Mission Community College District student. This means thousands of local students will no longer have to choose between taking the extra class they need to graduate or working an extra shift so they can afford groceries or pay rent.
Assembly Bill 2458, the GAINS for Student Parents Act, helps student parents succeed by ensuring financial aid packages factor in childcare expenses. These expenses pose significant barriers for the over 300,000 undergraduate student parents working to complete their higher education journey.
Assembly Bill 2176, sponsored by the Santa Clara County Office of Education, will help address the root causes of unacceptably high chronic absenteeism in our court schools by requiring the Office of Youth and Community Restoration to develop an annual report on chronic absenteeism rates in juvenile court schools, authorize investigations into the reasons for absenteeism, and facilitate assistance to address the identified causes. Research shows that denying access to education increases recidivism, violence in juvenile halls, and suicidal ideation among incarcerated youth. 
Assembly Bill 2057 improves the overly complex transfer process from community college to four-year university for students majoring in STEM fields. This law continues my eight years of work to ensure California’s higher education systems meet the needs of students.
Assembly Bill 1937 transfers a Caltrans property in Pacifica to California State Parks so that it can eventually serve as a trailhead for the California Coastal Trail. As California strives to expand public coastal access, it’s critically important that we keep public land in public hands so it can be used for public benefit.
Assembly Bill 2511 supports jobs and manufacturing in California and protects the environment by extending the operation of our successful Plastic Market Development program that incentivizes the reuse of empty plastic beverage containers for remanufacturing into new plastic products. 
Assembly Bill 2154 was developed with a group of San Mateo County parents who shared with me their experiences of family members facing a mental health emergency. This law ensures that if a person is involuntarily detained, then their family member will receive a patients’ rights handbook. Providing family members with valuable information and resources enables them to support their loved ones during a mental health crisis.
Assembly Bill 2164 seeks to reduce stigma for physicians seeking mental health care that does not impair their ability to practice medicine safely when applying for their license. The law responds to concerns I heard from doctors and medical students that sometimes they feel that they cannot participate in counseling or recovery programs for fear that they will jeopardize their license, even if they are confident that they can still practice medicine safely.
Assembly Bill 2199 extends an existing infill housing tool to help tackle the housing crisis.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Expedite Election Results,2024-12-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) will introduce legislation to assist counties in the prompt tallying and release of election results.
“California has one of the most accessible, secure, and transparent voting systems in the country. We also have some of the most competitive congressional and legislative races, due to our independent redistricting process and lack of political gerrymandering. These are things to be proud of, but they also lead to slower counts than other states that restrict voting rights and gerrymander boundaries to guarantee results before the first vote is even cast,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Unfortunately, we are already seeing Republicans in California and throughout the country use this to sow doubt about election results they don’t like, continuing their efforts to undermine our democracy.”
“Counties must do everything they can to count votes both quickly and accurately, and we need to make sure they have adequate resources and guidance to do that. I look forward to convening stakeholders to evaluate what is working and what we can do better to maintain our nation-leading voting rights while speeding up the count.”
Assemblymember Berman chaired the Assembly Elections Committee from 2017-2021, where he was a leader on protecting voting rights, shielding voters from deceptive elections practices, making election information more accessible, and improving election cybersecurity and campaign finance disclosure. He authored legislation to require elections officials to mail voters a ballot before every election, allow voters to track their vote by mail ballot, make it easier for students to vote by adding ballot drop boxes on campuses, add additional ways a voter can correct a missing or mismatching signature on a ballot envelope, and provide voters with a date certain by which to correct the missing or mismatched signature.

Marc Berman,Statement from Assemblymember Berman Regarding the Challenge Ahead,2024-11-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Assemblymember Marc Berman issued the following statement today:
""The shock and disbelief I felt last night felt like deja vu from the first time I was elected to the Assembly in 2016, the same night Trump won the first time. However, this morning feels very different from that first morning after the election eight years ago. Gone is the hope that Trump would moderate himself, or that he would surround himself with respected professionals to advise him. We must take him at his word that he will seek to execute on his campaign promises. This includes adding huge tariffs that will increase the price of goods, deporting 13 million immigrants and, as he gleefully proclaimed in his victory speech last night, putting renowned conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of our nation's health policies. ‘Go have a good time, Bobby,’ the President-elect said. 
We will all suffer the consequences of Bobby's good time, and of the other policies Trump has promised to enact. 
Just like eight years ago, California must once again do everything we can to protect our 39 million residents and our economy, the fifth largest in the world. We will double down on defending reproductive freedom and autonomy, on protecting the environment, and on investing in science and education. We will continue to enact policies that have proven to reduce the scourge of gun violence in our communities, and protect consumers from corporate greed. 
During a troubling time of division and attacks, we must do everything we can to exhibit civility and empathy for others. We are headed for turbulent times, as a state and as a nation. We must stay determined and come out stronger in the end.""

Marc Berman,California to Teach AI Literacy in Every Grade,2024-10-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA —Governor Newsom has signed AB 2876, Assemblymember Marc Berman’s (D-Menlo Park) legislation to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy into the core curriculum for all K-12 students in California. AB 2876 responds to the rapid proliferation of AI in nearly every aspect of young people’s lives, as well as the impact AI will have on their futures.
“AI has the potential to positively impact the way we live, but only if we know how to use it, and use it responsibly,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Children and young people today must navigate a world—and job market—transformed by fast-moving AI technology. We have a responsibility to ensure that all students, no matter their future profession, understand basic AI principles and applications, that they have the skills to recognize when AI is employed, and are aware of AI’s implications, limitations, and ethical considerations. This new law will equip all California students with the skills and training they need to be safe, ethical, and successful users of AI as it becomes more mainstream.”
“The importance of what AB 2876 will accomplish cannot be overstated. If California is to successfully harness the tremendous promise AI offers, it is vital that we place greater emphasis and resources on preparing students with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to identify, understand, and successfully utilize all kinds of AI that they may encounter in their future workplaces. Just like reading, writing, and arithmetic, digital literacy and AI literacy are basic skills that students need to develop if they are to succeed in the modern world,” said Ben Golombek, Chief of Staff for Policy, CalChamber. 
AB 2876 directs the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to incorporate AI literacy content into the mathematics, science, and history-social science curriculum frameworks and instructional materials at their next revision. The bill will also add media literacy to the English language arts/English language development, science, mathematics, and history-social science instructional materials when the materials are next revised.
AI literacy is defined as the knowledge, skills, and attitudes associated with how artificial intelligence works, including its principles, concepts, and applications, as well as how to use artificial intelligence, including its limitations, implications, and ethical considerations.
Studies have shown that early exposure to technology concepts can significantly influence students’ career paths and preparedness for the future. According to the 2023 AI Index report by the Stanford Institute for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, “the demand for AI-related professional skills is increasing across virtually every American industrial sector.” The report goes on to find, “AI systems are increasingly deployed in the real world. However, there often exists a disparity between the individuals who develop AI and those who use AI.”
According to a May 2023 special report in Education Week, experts argue “AI literacy is something that every student needs exposure to—not just those who are planning on a career in computer science” as “K-12 students have grown up in a world where artificial intelligence informs what their families buy at the grocery store, how scientists track the spread of diseases, and even how the photo filters work on their favorite social media apps.”

Marc Berman,California Criminalizes AI-Enabled Child Sexual Abuse,2024-09-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1831, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), to criminalize the creation, distribution, and possession of artificial intelligence-generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). The new law will address the rapidly accelerating dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies creating disturbing and harmful content resembling actual children. AB 1831 is one of three bills Assemblymember Berman successfully authored this year to protect Californians from fast-moving AI technology and advance the responsible use of AI.
“Child sexual abuse material must be illegal to create, possess, and distribute in California, whether the images are AI generated or of actual children. AI that is used to create these awful images is trained from thousands of images of real children being abused, revictimizing those children all over again,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""I'm grateful to Governor Newsom for signing AB 1831, which will ensure that the sexual exploitation of children in California is illegal—including AI-generated pictures and videos of children being sexually abused. This would not be possible without the powerful advocacy from survivors of AI-generated sexual exploitation, like Disney star Kaylin Hayman, who bravely testified to the lasting harm this digital abuse causes to children. I'm grateful to law enforcement for bringing this to my attention and working with me to make sure more children aren't victimized in the future.”
In addition to AB 1831, Governor Newsom signed AB 2876 (Berman) which integrates AI literacy content into the core curriculum for all K-12 students in California. Earlier this month, the Governor signed AB 2655 (Berman), a first-in-the-nation policy to require online platforms to restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes meant to deceive or disenfranchise voters based on fraudulent content.
 “Unregulated A.I. has the potential to exploit many, especially children. SAG-AFTRA applauds Governor Newsom for signing AB 1831. We are grateful for Assemblymember Marc Berman’s leadership, and the California Legislature for moving the bill to the governor’s desk. Now that this bill is signed into law, we can better protect minors from those who might use A.I. technology to cause harm,” said SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
“Assemblymember Berman, with his keen understanding of the dangers posed by deepfake technology, was instrumental in guiding this bill to signature,"" said Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko. ""Working with Kaylin Hayman, who courageously shared her experience as a victim of morphed child pornography, we were able to expose the real-life evils of computer-generated images. Kaylin’s strength and determination to advocate for this bill will protect minors in the future, and her efforts played a pivotal role in enacting this legislation. Today, a dangerous AI loophole has now been closed.""
“The emergence over the past year of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) platforms that can be used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and facilitate child sexual exploitation is a recent example of a new technology that is challenging efforts to keep children safe and to detect, identify, remove, investigate, and prosecute online CSAM and sexually exploitative content relating to children. NCMEC supports AB 1831 because it addresses gaps in California’s legal remedies for child victims of GAI CSAM. Many child sexual exploitation cases are prosecuted at the state level, and we are heartened to see states move quickly to revise their CSAM and related laws to ensure that GAI CSAM is criminalized,” said Michelle DeLaune, President & CEO, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).
“I am very happy to be working with these inspiring people as well as making history. It is my honor to be shining light on this terrible reality for other victims. I’m blessed to be in this position and forever grateful for this team! I look forward to seeing this bill be signed and put into action,” said Kaylin Hayman, a survivor and victim advocate, and former Disney child actor.
“We are happy to support the people who are responsible for the creation of this law that is going to help protect so many children from being victimized. Our entire family is very proud of Kaylin's bravery and resilience on this journey. Hopefully this law will set a precedent for other states and will make predators accountable for the crimes they are committing,"" said Mark and Shalene Hayman, Kaylin's parents.

 “We thank the Governor for recognizing by signing this bill that our criminal statutes against abusing or endangering children must clearly reach the sickening and public sexualization of their appearances,” said Ed Howard, Senior Counsel, Children’s Advocacy Institute, University of San Diego School of Law.
""Common Sense Media applauds Assemblymember Berman's efforts to safeguard children online with the introduction of this bill, AB 1831, which builds on the success of AB 1394, a bill that was signed into law last year to help stamp out the deeply harmful problem of online child sex trafficking. This new bill employs a similarly proactive approach, this time protecting kids and teens against online exploitation that is exacerbated by the rise of AI. California should take the lead when it comes to protecting kids and families from the negative impacts of this powerful new technology,” said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO, Common Sense Media.
AB 1831 is co-sponsored by Common Sense Media, SAG-AFTRA, University of San Diego School of Law Children’s Advocacy Institute, the California District Attorneys Association, and Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Law Waiving Tuition for All Students at West Valley-Mission Community College District Starting in 2025,2024-09-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced that Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 3158, which enables West Valley-Mission Community College District (WVMCCD) to waive tuition fees for the thousands of students living in its service area starting on January 1, 2025. Student testimonials and remarks from Assemblymember Berman and Chancellor Davis will be provided at the “AB 3158: Beyond the Promise—Free College for Every Student” press conference on Monday, September 30, from 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM at the Student Services Courtyard of West Valley College.
“The passage of AB 3158 is a huge win for all students of the West Valley-Mission Community College District and I am grateful to Governor Newsom for his signature to guarantee free tuition for thousands of local students,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Two-thirds of California’s community college students struggle with basic needs insecurities such as food and housing, a reality mirrored in West Valley-Mission Community College District’s student population. In the South Bay and Peninsula in particular, the soaring costs of living pose a steep hurdle for local community college students.”
“This new law gives our local community college district the authority to put significant financial resources back into students’ pockets, ensuring they don’t have to choose between taking the extra class they need to graduate or working an extra shift so they can afford groceries or pay rent. I applaud the leadership at West Valley-Mission Community College District for doing everything they can to support their students as they achieve their higher education dreams,” continued Assemblymember Berman.
Addressing the impacts of the Bay Area's astronomical cost of living, AB 3158 will alleviate the burden of state-mandated tuition fees. WVMCCD, funded through local property taxes, has successfully balanced its budget in recent years without imposing student fees. This was achieved through the District’s College Promise Scholarship. Chancellor Bradley Davis shared that while over 5,000 students have enrolled in the program, this law is needed to simplify the process and dramatically expand free tuition access.
“With AB 3158, every student in our service area—whether full-time, part-time, or returning to school—will have access to free, high-quality education without the financial or procedural obstacles that have held many back. This law cuts out complicated forms and delays, making it as easy as enrolling and attending. It's a significant step forward in our mission to remove barriers for our students,” said Chancellor Davis.
Trustee Adrienne Grey emphasized the importance of expanding access to a diverse range of students: “Community colleges serve students from all walks of life, many of whom don’t fit into the traditional college mold. This bill opens doors for people retooling their careers, balancing family responsibilities, or lacking the support to navigate complex financial aid forms. It’s a vital step toward ensuring equity in education and making sure no one is left behind.”
Trustee Robert Owens highlighted the district's fiscal responsibility in enacting the bill: “This isn’t just about waiving fees—it’s about smart governance. AB 3158 allows us to use our local resources more effectively, without increasing the District’s budget or asking for more state funding. It’s a win-win for students and taxpayers alike.”
Former West Valley College Student Trustee Melanie Ho shared her perspective as a student, acknowledging the personal impact of the law: “Because of the soaring costs of living in the Bay Area, many students are trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck.” By increasing access, Ho notes that this bill will “ease financial strain and foster a more equitable learning environment.”
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic, WVMCCD has seen a resurgence in overall enrollment. With new bachelor’s degrees and workforce development programs on the horizon, the district is set to broaden its impact with more comprehensive educational pathways.
“This bill comes during a renaissance of opportunity for our district, underscoring our commitment to inclusivity and educational enrichment. It is a testament to our belief that unrestricted access to education is a fundamental right, pivotal in unlocking the full potential within our community,” shared Chancellor Davis.
AB 3158 was sponsored by West Valley-Mission Community College District and has support from local legislators. State Senators Josh Becker and Dave Cortese are principal co-authors and Assemblymember Evan Low and Gail Pellerin are co-authors.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs New Law to Keep Incarcerated Students in School,2024-09-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Yesterday Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 2176, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will expand the Office of Youth and Community Restoration’s (OYCR) authority to support a public health approach to juvenile detention. The new law requires OYCR to develop an annual report on chronic absenteeism rates in juvenile court schools, authorizes investigations into the reasons for absenteeism, and facilitates technical assistance to address the identified causes.
“The California Constitution guarantees incarcerated youth the right to an equitable education, yet more than a dozen California court schools reported that over 30% of their students were chronically absent in the 2021-2022 school year. This new law is an urgently needed intervention to address the root causes of institutions denying youth access to school,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Chronic absenteeism is linked to lower graduation rates, diminished academic achievement, and reduced college attendance. We must ensure that all children have access to school, even while they are incarcerated. Thank you to Governor Newsom for signing AB 2176 to strengthen the fundamental right to an equitable education.”
Assemblymember Marc Berman thanks education partners, including the Santa Clara County Office of Education, the California County Superintendents, and the California Federation of Teachers, as well as a broad coalition of equity groups, including ACLU, the Youth Law Center, and Public Counsel, for championing this bill. 
“Education is critical to the growth, wellbeing, and reintegration of incarcerated individuals, especially youth,” stated Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools. “Research shows that denying access to education increases recidivism, violence in juvenile halls, and suicidal ideation among incarcerated youth. AB 2176 will re-affirm every child’s fundamental right to an equitable education in California and establish new systems to support juvenile justice programs that are struggling to ensure children have access to school. I am grateful to Assemblymember Berman for his courageous advocacy in support of California’s youth.” 
""The Youth Law Center thanks Assemblymember Marc Berman, the California Legislature, and Gov. Newsom for passing and signing AB 2176 into law to improve outcomes for some of California’s most underserved students by addressing chronic absenteeism in juvenile court schools. This legislation is an important step forward to ensure students in California's court schools are not left out of sight and out of mind. We hope that the Office of Youth and Community Restoration can further investigate causes of court school absenteeism and that the state will invest in necessary solutions to meet our legal mandate to ensure these students have access to school and our moral mandate to offer the quality education that can be a life changing intervention,” said Christopher Middleton, Equal Justice Works Fellow at Youth Law Center Sponsored by Baker McKenzie & and Salesforce, Inc.
“California’s constitution guarantees all students the right to an education. This includes students in juvenile detention facilities, whose access to education is simultaneously susceptible to disruption and critical to young peoples’ success. AB 2176 provides an opportunity for county offices of education, the Office of Youth and Community Restoration, and probation departments to collaborate in identifying why some court schools experience chronic absenteeism and developing data-driven methods to ensure court school students can access their educations. PJDC looks forward to seeing how AB 2176 can support some of California’s most vulnerable students: our clients in detention,” said Pacific Juvenile Defender Center.
AB 2176 continues the proud legacy of the California Legislature and Governor ensuring that detention for youth is truly restorative and centers a public health approach.

Marc Berman,Governor Newsom Signs Historic Legislation to Shield Elections from Deceptive Online Deepfakes,2024-09-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — Today Governor Gavin Newsom signed historic legislation to ban deceptive deepfakes in the run up to an election. Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), AB 2655 will protect election integrity by requiring large online platforms to, in response to a complaint, remove the posting of deceptive and digitally altered or created images, audio, or video recordings meant to give the impression that a candidate or elected official did or said something they did not do or say. The narrowly tailored law is an essential step to protect our democracy from the growing threat of AI-generated disinformation.
“AI-generated disinformation poses a clear and present risk to our elections and our democracy. We have already seen firsthand how deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage disinformation campaigns. AB 2655 is a first-in-the-nation solution to this growing threat, and I am grateful to Governor Newsom for signing it,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""Imagine if a fake but very realistic video appeared online of a candidate for office accepting a bribe or saying that they’d hacked voting machines to ensure their victory? Advances in AI over the last few years make it remarkably easy for practically anyone to generate this hyper-realistic content. AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes meant to deceive or disenfranchise voters based on fraudulent content. The new law is a win for California’s voters, and for our democracy.""
""With the Governor's signature, California has signaled to the rest of the country that it is ready to lead the fight against AI-powered disinformation,"" said Jonathan Mehta Stein, Executive Director at California Common Cause and Board Chair of the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy, which sponsored the bill. ""Our hands-off, laissez faire approach to social media regulation 20 years ago has caused all sorts of dire, society-wide problems. With today's move, California has signaled we won't make the same mistake with AI.”
AB 2655 creates a process to ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes. Specifically, the bill would require a large online platform, in the run up to an election, to remove specific deceptive content intended to defraud voters and undermine confidence in elections, upon receipt of a complaint, for a period of time before an election.
For less malicious, but still materially deceptive content, the platform would need to label the material as manipulated and not authentic.
Since 2020, voters have seen disinformation pollute our politics more than ever, and now with AI-generated deepfakes becoming a routine part of our information ecosystems, the issue is rapidly intensifying. We have already seen deepfakes destabilizing national elections in Argentina, Slovakia, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and the US presidential primary. Just as this problem is peaking, many technology and social media platforms are decreasing their investments in their trust and safety teams and walking away from any responsibility to address it. Voters are now left to pick up the pieces, not knowing what images, audio, and video they can trust.

Marc Berman,Legislature Approves Bill to Protect Children from AI-Enabled Sexual Exploitation,2024-09-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Tonight the Legislature passed AB 1831, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), to criminalize the creation, distribution, and possession of artificial intelligence-generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). If signed by the Governor, AB 1831 will address the emerging dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies creating disturbing and harmful content resembling actual children.
“AB 1831’s passage through the Legislature brings California one step closer to cracking down on AI-generated pictures and videos of children being sexually abused. This would not be possible if it were not for the powerful advocacy from survivors of AI-generated sexual exploitation, who gave voice to the lasting harm this abuse of technology causes,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Current law allows real children’s photos to be scraped from the internet, including from social media profiles and school websites, and turned into AI-generated sexually explicit content that can be virtually indistinguishable from real children. The sexual exploitation of children must be illegal, full stop. When signed by Governor Newsom, AB 1831 will be a victory for all children and families in California.”
“Unregulated A.I. has the potential to exploit many, especially children. SAG-AFTRA applauds Assemblymember Marc Berman and the California Legislature for getting AB 1831 to the governor’s desk. We strongly urge Governor Newsom to sign this essential bill into law, and protect minors from those who would use A.I. technology to cause harm,” said SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
“I am very happy to be working with these inspiring people as well as making history. It is my honor to be shining light on this terrible reality for other victims. I’m blessed to be in this position and forever grateful for this team! I look forward to seeing this bill be signed and put into action,” said Kaylin Hayman, a survivor and victim advocate, and former Disney child actor.
“We are happy to support the people who are responsible for the creation of this law that is going to help protect so many children from being victimized. Our entire family is very proud of Kaylin's bravery and resilience on this journey. Hopefully this law will set a precedent for other states and will make predators accountable for the crimes they are committing,"" said Mark and Shalene Hayman, Kaylin's parents.
“Right now, there is a gap in California Law,” said Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko. “Changes need to be made to keep up with the quickly changing technology. This is a serious, prurient, and very disturbing problem. I urge Governor Newsom to sign AB1831 into law.”
“We urgently need to ensure that our criminal statutes against abusing or endangering children clearly reach the sickening and public sexualization of their appearances,” said Ed Howard, Senior Counsel, Children’s Advocacy Institute, University of San Diego School of Law.
""Common Sense Media applauds Assemblymember Berman's efforts to safeguard children online with the introduction of this bill, AB 1831, which builds on the success of AB 1394, a bill that was signed into law last year to help stamp out the deeply harmful problem of online child sex trafficking. This new bill employs a similarly proactive approach, this time protecting kids and teens against online exploitation that is exacerbated by the rise of AI. California should take the lead when it comes to protecting kids and families from the negative impacts of this powerful new technology,” said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO, Common Sense Media.
AB 1831 is co-sponsored by Common Sense Media, SAG-AFTRA, University of San Diego School of Law Children’s Advocacy Institute, the California District Attorneys Association, and Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko. The bill now heads to the Governor’s desk for its final hurdle.

Marc Berman,Bill to Shield Elections from Deceptive Online Deepfakes Passes Legislature,2024-08-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — Today the Legislature passed AB 2655, authored by Assemblymember Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will protect election integrity by requiring large online platforms to remove, after receipt of a complaint, the posting of deceptive and digitally altered or created images, audio, or video recordings meant to give the impression that a candidate or elected official did or said something they did not do or say. This bill, which is narrowly tailored to apply close to an election, is an essential step to protect California voters – and our democracy – from the real and growing threat of disinformation that is turbocharged by generative AI and deepfakes.
“We have entered the age of AI-generated disinformation, which poses a severe risk to our elections and our democracy. Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage disinformation campaigns, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on our democracy by attributing speech and conduct to a person that is false or that never happened,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes meant to deceive or disenfranchise voters based on fraudulent content. Advances in AI over the last few years make it too easy for practically anyone to generate this hyper-realistic content. AB 2655’s passage through the Legislature is a win for California’s voters, and for our democracy.""
""The social media platforms who profit so mightily off of hosting our democratic discourse as a nation have a responsibility to take the modest steps necessary to protect that discourse, and to make sure voters are not being deceived and defrauded,"" said Jonathan Mehta Stein, Executive Director of California Common Cause and the Board Chair at the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy. ""The passage of AB 2655 brings us one step closer to healthy information ecosystems and a digital democracy that serves the people.""
If signed by the Governor, AB 2655 will create a process to ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes. Specifically, the bill would require a large online platform, in the run up to an election, to remove specific deceptive content intended to defraud voters and undermine confidence in elections, upon receipt of a complaint, for a period of time before an election. Moreover, there is a need to educate voters about less harmful yet still materially deceptive content at times less proximate to an election. Therefore, AB 2655 would require large online platforms, in response to a complaint, to label materially deceptive content that is outside the timeframe for removal or in an advertisement or election communication not subject to the removal.
Since 2020, voters have seen disinformation pollute our politics more than ever, and now with AI-generated deepfakes becoming a routine part of our information ecosystems, the issue is rapidly intensifying.

Marc Berman,Legislature Passes Bill to Keep Incarcerated Students in School,2024-08-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the passage through the Legislature of AB 2176, which will expand the Office of Youth and Community Restoration’s (OYCR) authority to support a public health approach to juvenile detention. If signed by the Governor, the bill will require OYCR to develop an annual report on chronic absenteeism rates in juvenile court schools, investigate the reasons for absenteeism, and provide technical assistance to address the identified causes.
“The California Constitution guarantees incarcerated youth the right to an equitable education, yet in some counties youth in juvenile facilities are prevented from accessing school for more than 10% of the year. AB 2176 is an urgently needed intervention to address the root causes of institutions denying youth access to school,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Chronic absenteeism is linked to lower graduation rates, diminished academic achievement, and reduced college attendance. We must ensure that all children have access to school, even while they are incarcerated. Thank you to the Santa Clara County Office of Education for their partnership in our effort to strengthen the fundamental right to an equitable education.”
Assemblymember Marc Berman thanks education partners, including the Santa Clara County Office of Education, the California County Superintendents, and the California Federation of Teachers, as well as a broad coalition of equity groups, including ACLU, the Youth Law Center, and Public Counsel, for championing this bill. 
“Education is critical to the growth, wellbeing, and reintegration of incarcerated individuals, especially youth,” stated Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, Santa Clara County Superintendent of Schools. “Research shows that denying access to education increases recidivism, violence in juvenile halls, and suicidal ideation among incarcerated youth. AB 2176 will re-affirm every child’s fundamental right to an equitable education in California and establish new systems to support juvenile justice programs that are struggling to ensure children have access to school. I am grateful to Assemblymember Berman for his courageous advocacy in support of California’s youth.” 
AB 2176 continues the proud legacy of the California Legislature and Governor ensuring that detention for youth is truly restorative and centers a public health approach.

Marc Berman,Bill to Provide Free Tuition at West Valley-Mission Community College District Passes Legislature,2024-08-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today the Legislature overwhelmingly passed AB 3158, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will enable West Valley-Mission Community College District (WVMCCD) to waive tuition fees for all students living in its service area. The bill now awaits the Governor’s signature.
“Today’s bipartisan vote for AB 3158 is a huge win for all students of the West Valley-Mission Community College District, bringing us just one step away from free tuition for all,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Two-thirds of California’s community college students struggle with basic needs insecurities such as food and housing, a reality mirrored in WVMCCD’s student population. In the South Bay and Peninsula in particular, the soaring costs of living pose a steep hurdle for local community college students.”
“AB 3158 gives our local community college district the authority to put significant financial resources back into students’ pockets, ensuring they don’t have to choose between taking the extra class they need to graduate or working an extra shift so they can afford groceries or pay rent. I applaud the leadership at West Valley-Mission Community College District for doing everything they can to support their students as they achieve their higher education dreams,” continued Assemblymember Berman.
Addressing the impacts of the Bay Area's astronomical cost of living, AB 3158 will alleviate the burden of state-mandated tuition fees. WVMCCD, funded through local property taxes, has successfully balanced its budget in recent years without imposing student fees. This was achieved through the District’s College Promise Scholarship. Chancellor Bradley Davis shared that while over 5,000 students have enrolled in the program, this bill is needed to simplify the process and dramatically expand free tuition access.
“While our Promise Program has been a huge step in the right direction, making it operational has been a complex and costly endeavor. This bill will streamline the process, making free education a reality and empowering our staff to focus on what they do best: nurturing the minds and talents of our students,” Chancellor Davis said.
West Valley College Student Trustee Melanie Ho shares, ""Because of the soaring costs of living in the Bay Area, many students are trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck.” By increasing access, Ho notes that this bill will “ease financial strain and foster a more equitable learning environment.”
Expanding access to free education is not just a boon for students; it's an investment in the community. Studies indicate that higher education correlates with increased economic activity, reduced crime rates, and enhanced civic engagement. By fostering an educated workforce, this bill is poised to yield long-term benefits for the local economy and community well-being.
Board President Anne Kepner adds, “In an effort to eliminate barriers preventing students from achieving their educational goals, the Board recently allocated resources to waive student health and parking fees, provide free childcare for students, and have approved a pilot program to waive tuition for students living in our service area. We are grateful to Assemblymember Marc Berman for championing a bill allowing us to expand our free tuition program.”
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic, WVMCCD has seen a resurgence in overall enrollment. With new bachelor’s degrees and workforce development programs on the horizon, the District is set to broaden its impact with more comprehensive educational pathways.
“This bill comes during a renaissance of opportunity for our district, underscoring our commitment to inclusivity and educational enrichment. It is a testament to our belief that unrestricted access to education is a fundamental right, pivotal in unlocking every student's potential,” shared Chancellor Davis.
AB 3158 is sponsored by West Valley-Mission Community College District and has support from local legislators. State Senators Josh Becker and Dave Cortese are principal co-authors and Assemblymember Evan Low and Gail Pellerin are co-authors.
Assemblymember Marc Berman represents the 23rd Assembly District, which includes southern San Mateo County and northern Santa Clara County in the heart of the Silicon Valley.

Marc Berman,California Cracks Down on Retail Theft,2024-08-16,press_release,NA,"SAN JOSE– Today the Governor signed AB 3209, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Salinas), which creates the first-of-its-kind Retail Crime Restraining Order. The bill authorizes a court to impose a Retail Crime Restraining Order upon conviction, or following two or more citations, for a theft offense, vandalism within the store, or battery on an employee within the store. AB 3209 is a key provision in the Assembly’s comprehensive bipartisan legislative package addressing retail crime and theft in California.
“Across my district, from San Jose to Stanford Shopping Center to Pacifica, small businesses and large retailers alike have suffered from retail theft. Whether you are shopping at a local store or working there, every Californian deserves to feel safe,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “AB 3209 will help protect our local businesses, employees, and shoppers by creating a needed enforcement tool to combat organized and repeated retail theft. The creation of a Retail Crime Restraining Order, which received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Legislature, is a key component in the comprehensive retail theft legislative package. Rather than take us back to the failed policies of the 80s and 90s, these new laws were crafted with our partners in the retail and grocery industries to provide Californians with smart and thoughtful solutions to reduce retail crime. I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing these bills here in San Jose, where I know many customers are sick of shopping for items locked behind cages.”
“California’s hard-working business owners asked for our help, and today we are delivering thoughtful, balanced new laws that will protect their livelihoods, workers and customers. To those who brazenly harass and shoplift from our stores: Accountability is here. I’m deeply proud of my colleagues for taking on this crucial public-safety issue, and I thank Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur, the Governor, Pro Tem and Attorney General for their dedication and leadership. In California, we keep each other safe and get the job done,” said Speaker of the Assembly Robert Rivas, D – Salinas.
AB 3209 is supported by Attorney General Rob Bonta, the California Retailers Association, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the League of California Cities.
“I am committed to bringing the full force of the California Department of Justice to fight organized retail crime both in the field and in the courtroom, and AB 3209 provides important new tools to help businesses protect themselves and their employees,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. “Organized retail crime hurts the workers and businesses that keep our economy strong and poses a serious threat to our communities. I'm grateful to Assemblymember Berman and Governor Newsom for their hard work and collaboration in the battle against organized retail crime, and I was proud to support this important legislation. We won't stop fighting to keep our communities, businesses, and consumers safe from the threat of organized retail crime.""
“Local law enforcement officers and business owners need every available resource to combat repeat retail theft, and AB 3209 provides a new enforcement tool to help keep our communities safe,” said League of California Cities Executive Director and CEO Carolyn Coleman. “Cal Cities is proud to support this important legislation, and commends the Legislature for their work to address retail theft this session.”
“We’ve heard from many businesses in our communities along the Peninsula about their concerns for the safety of their employees and customers due to the increasingly bold actions of shoplifters and organized retail theft rings,” said Mountain View Councilmember and League of California Cities Peninsula Division President Ellen Kamei. “This legislation will help protect our local businesses from repeat offenders and support safe neighborhoods.”
""For the past year, the California Retailers Association has worked with Assemblymember Marc Berman on AB 3209, which will help deter retail theft and keep our employees, customers and businesses safe from retail crime,” said Rachel Michelin, President + CEO of the California Retailers Association. “This bill provides a new enforcement tool that will keep stores and workers safe from crime as rates of retail theft and robbery have risen in California. We are very appreciative of Assemblymember Berman’s leadership on this important issue, which will help safeguard our local businesses, protecting the livelihoods of hardworking employees and promote a safer and more prosperous retail shopping environment for all.”
""Petty theft remains one of the most prevalent barriers to economic health and recovery for our small businesses. We applaud thoughtful efforts to curtail this crime,"" said Peter Katz, President and CEO, Mountain View Chamber of Commerce & Foundation.
""""The new laws signed by Governor Newsom today provide important tools for law enforcement and prosecutors to crack down on organized crime rings and retail thieves, and also send a strong signal that California is serious about holding criminals accountable. Among the bills signed today is AB 3209 by Assemblymember Marc Berman which provides an important new enforcement tool that will keep stores and workers safer from the threat of retail crime and robberies. We are grateful that so many groups came together – including business and retail leaders, law enforcement and policy makers – to address the problem with meaningful reforms,” said Jennifer Barrera, CalChamber President and CEO. 
 
The Assembly’s comprehensive legislative package to address retail theft and crime will deliver new tools for California to strengthen public safety and protect shoppers and retail operators. The package of bills does this in a thoughtful way to ensure our laws adequately protect Californians from crime while not leading to mass incarceration or discriminatory outcomes. Learn more about the full package of bills here or watch the signing ceremony here with remarks from Governor Newsom and Assemblymember Berman.
Recent trends in retail theft and commercial robbery vary notably throughout the state. The Bay Area had the highest reported rates of shoplifting in California in 2022, experiencing sharp increases in rates. Specifically, shoplifting rates in San Mateo County increased 53 percent between 2019 and 2022, and San Francisco County saw a 24 percent increase. The growing issue of retail theft as well as vandalism and assault on employees in retail must be addressed to ensure the safety of our communities and businesses. In 2023, the California State Assembly established a Select Committee on Retail Theft to further examine this problem and seek thoughtful solutions that do not create undue hardship to our communities. A retail crime restraining order is one of these solutions that provides a balance in providing enforcement tools for retail crimes while implementing a reasonable restriction that does not exacerbate the underlying issues of poverty.

Marc Berman,"Encouraged by Conversations with VTA Leaders, Berman Pauses Governance Reform Legislation",2024-06-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in regards to his bill, AB 1958, to implement the good governance recommendations made by the State Auditor in their audit of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).
“I am encouraged by the conversations I have had with VTA leadership in the last week, and therefore have decided to pause legislative efforts to reform VTA's governance structure for this year. While I found VTA's official response to the government audit recommendations to be inadequate, I know that we are all united in a desire to create a governance structure that provides the transparency, the stability, and the expertise that VTA needs and that transit riders and Santa Clara County taxpayers deserve,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “VTA has recently broken ground on some of the biggest, most expensive projects in the agency's history. There has never been a more important time to make sure VTA has a Board of Directors that is equipped and empowered to provide the high quality oversight needed to ensure these projects are successful.”
As requested by Assemblymember Berman in 2023, the State Auditor conducted an audit of VTA regarding the agency’s governance structure, project planning and management, financial viability, and fiscal oversight. Read the state audit here.
The audit identified board appointment transparency and board member experience as key areas for improvement. The audit reported, “the processes for appointing VTA’s directors are not always transparent enough to ensure the appointment of directors with experience in transportation. For example, one group of cities in the county does not meet publicly when it decides who to appoint as its director. Once appointed, VTA’s directors have briefer tenures than those of peer transit agencies, and this is due, in part, to the shorter term lengths that state law establishes for VTA directors compared to the term lengths of other agencies’ directors. As a result, VTA’s board has less experience overseeing the agency’s operations than the boards of peer agencies.”

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Reacts to State Audit of VTA,2024-06-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - The California State Auditor released of a comprehensive state audit of the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) yesterday, an audit that was conducted at the request of Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park). The State Auditor reviewed VTA’s governance structure, project planning and management, financial viability, and fiscal oversight. Read the state audit here.
“Yesterday the State Auditor confirmed what we have known for years: VTA’s process for appointing directors lacks the appropriate transparency that the public demands, and the short length of terms that members serve is both an outlier among similar transit agencies and is an unnecessary obstacle to board members developing the expertise needed to provide the high-quality oversight of the agency that riders, VTA staff, and Santa Clara County taxpayers deserve,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “This is not a surprise, as three Civil Grand Jury Reports, multiple consultants hired by VTA, and a 2008 audit by the State Auditor have identified the need for similar changes to VTA’s governance structure.
However, I am both surprised and disappointed that VTA has rejected the Auditor’s recommendations to address these longstanding good governance issues. I do not understand why VTA would choose to protect their power to appoint and remove board members behind closed doors with no public transparency or justification, undermining the agency’s accountability to residents. I do not understand why VTA thinks it is better for board members to serve for shorter amounts of time given the breadth and complexity of the services VTA provides. Like the State Auditor, I found VTA’s rationale for rejecting these recommendations to be woefully inadequate,” said Assemblymember Berman.
In 2022, Assemblymember Berman and former San José Vice Mayor and past VTA Board Chair Chappie Jones jointly called for a state audit of VTA’s governance structure, fiscal management, and project planning and monitoring. Read their announcement from 2022 here.
“The State Auditor looked beyond parochial political interests to provide urgently needed impartial recommendations for VTA,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I am grateful for former San Jose Vice Mayor Chappie Jones’ partnership in our shared endeavor to create a transparent and experienced board of directors. I would also like to thank the State Auditor and his staff for their thorough audit and their commitment to the improvement of public agencies.”

According to the 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, VTA’s operating performance has continued to deteriorate over the last 10 years, relative to both its own historical performance and the performance of its peers, across a wide variety of metrics. Notwithstanding numerous reviews confirming structural barriers to success, many of these barriers have not yet been addressed.
VTA’s own 2021 Board Self-Assessment, which interviewed board members, states that board members felt that “cities or agencies often select a VTA representative based upon that individual’s interest in higher elected office, and not on their interest in and familiarity with transportation.”
As directed by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, the State Auditor conducted an audit of VTA regarding the agency’s governance structure, project planning and management, financial viability, and fiscal oversight.
In regards to governance, the audit identified experience and transparency as key areas for improvement. The audit reported, “the processes for appointing VTA’s directors are not always transparent enough to ensure the appointment of directors with experience in transportation. For example, one group of cities in the county does not meet publicly when it decides who to appoint as its director. Once appointed, VTA’s directors have briefer tenures than those of peer transit agencies, and this is due, in part, to the shorter term lengths that state law establishes for VTA directors compared to the term lengths of other agencies’ directors. As a result, VTA’s board has less experience overseeing the agency’s operations than the boards of peer agencies.”
In addition to governance reform, the audit found that VTA needs to strengthen its planning and oversight of capital projects. For example, “when VTA estimates the costs of capital projects, it does not always estimate the cost to operate and maintain the project. 
Additionally, VTA’s staff do not provide regular updates to the board about variances from the cost estimates it develops before the construction of a project. For example, the construction cost of one project we reviewed increased by about 24 percent from the start of construction. Without regular information about cost increases such as this one, the board has diminished insight into capital project performance.”
This is similar to concerns raised in January by VTA’s own internal auditor general, who found that VTA staff misled the board of directors about the true BART to Silicon Valley project cost and engaged in a “breach of transparency.”

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Names Pacific Beach Coalition as 2024 Nonprofit of the Year,2024-05-31,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced today that he has named the Pacific Beach Coalition as the 23rd Assembly District ‘Nonprofit of the Year’ for the organization’s outstanding contributions to the community.
“I am honored to recognize Pacific Beach Coalition for their work to clean and restore San Mateo County’s beaches and creeks. Coastal access is inscribed in California’s constitution, but these breathtaking natural resources wouldn’t exist without an army of volunteers protecting and preserving the health of our ocean, beaches, native wildlife, and habitat,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “I have seen firsthand how Pacific Beach Coalition allows anyone to feel like they can be a guardian of San Mateo County’s beautiful wildlands. PBC and their volunteers created a legacy of cleaner local beaches, healthier wildlife, and a community knit together through environmental stewardship.”
“Pacific Beach Coalition is not just important because of the trash and cigarette pickups but can you imagine what the sealife benefits from this. People locally plus businesses outside of the coast come here to help clean up our beaches and surrounding areas. I am always surprised when I walk the beach, that there is no trash to pick up, all because of the Beach Coalition. Thank you for your many years of keeping the beaches clean,” said Pacifica Mayor Sue Vaterlaus.
“The Pacific Beach Coalition team is deeply honored to be recognized by Assemblymember Marc Berman as a 2024 Nonprofit of the Year. Our planet needs the actions, deeds and commitment of everyone. If the Pacific Beach Coalition can engage, educate and inspire volunteers to take that first step we hope that the esteem and connection to each other and to the planet will grow and grow into a healthier planet and happier people,” said Lynn Adams, Pacific Beach Coalition President.
Headquartered in the City of Pacifica, the Pacific Beach Coalition is dedicated to preserving the ocean, coastal habitat, and wildlife, and ending litter through advocacy, education, community building, and citizen action. PBC’s passionate volunteers came from all over the Bay area, the East Bay, TriValley and Sacramento to clean San Mateo County’s beaches. Monthly cleanups have now extended to beaches south of Pacifica which includes Montara and Half Moon Bay. In 2022, Coastal Cleanup Day yielded 27,000 volunteers who picked up more than 220,861 pounds of trash in San Mateo County. Pacific Beach Coalition also saw 2,755 volunteer participants in their Street to Beach Cleanup program who picked up an astounding 135,083 pounds of trash throughout the Peninsula.

Marc Berman,Assembly Approves Bill to Shield Elections from Deceptive Online Deepfakes,2024-05-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — Today, Assemblymember Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the passage through the Assembly of AB 2655, which will protect election integrity by requiring large online platforms to restrict, for a limited period, the posting and distribution of deceptive and digitally altered or created images, audio, or video recordings meant to give the impression that a candidate or elected official did or said something they did not do or say. This bill is an essential step to protect California’s democracy and voters from one of its current greatest threats: disinformation turbocharged by generative AI and deepfakes.
“We have entered the age of AI-generated disinformation, which poses a severe risk to our elections and our democracy. AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes meant to prevent voters from voting or to deceive them based on fraudulent content,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage disinformation campaigns, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on our democracy by attributing speech and conduct to a person that is false or that never happened. Advances in AI over the last few years make it easy for practically anyone to generate this deceptive content, making it that much more important that we identify and restrict its spread before it has the chance to deceive voters and undermine our democracy.""
“AI-powered disinformation is a dire threat to our democracy, and is emerging at a moment when our democracy is already badly weakened,” said Jonathan Mehta Stein, California Common Cause’s executive director. “Using an unbiased, independent, interdisciplinary approach, CITED and our legislative partners have developed a legislative package that protects voters and the integrity of our elections, while upholding free speech and respecting technological innovation.”
Since 2020, voters have seen disinformation pollute our politics more than ever, and now with AI-generated deepfakes becoming a routine part of our information ecosystems, the issue is rapidly intensifying. We have already seen deepfakes destabilizing national elections in Argentina, Slovakia, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and the US presidential primary. Just as this problem is peaking, many technology and social media platforms are decreasing their investments in their trust and safety teams and walking away from any responsibility to address it. Voters are now left to pick up the pieces, not knowing what images, audio, and video they can trust.

Marc Berman,Bill to Protect Children from AI Enabled Sexual Exploitation Passes Assembly,2024-05-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Assembly passed AB 1831, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), to criminalize the creation, distribution, and possession of artificial intelligence-generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). AB 1831 will address the emerging dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can create disturbing and harmful content resembling actual children.
“The sexual exploitation of children must be illegal, full stop. Today’s resounding bipartisan support for AB 1831 brings us one step closer to cracking down on AI generated pictures and videos of children being sexually abused. A gap in current law allows real children’s photos to be scraped from the internet, including from social media profiles and school websites, and turned into AI generated sexually explicit content that can be virtually indistinguishable from real children,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “The powerful advocacy of survivors of AI-generated sexual exploitation give voice to the profound harm this abhorrent abuse of technology causes, and underscores the urgent need to pass AB 1831 to protect children across our state.”
“This legislation is critical to protecting children from being exploited by rapidly advancing AI. I applaud the California State Assembly for advancing this important bill, and for Assemblymember Berman for his leadership on this issue. SAG-AFTRA urges the swift passage of AB 1831, and we call on the State Senate and Governor Newsom to enact this law as soon as possible,” said SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles Local President Jodi Long.
 “I am very happy to be working with these inspiring people as well as making history. It is my honor to be shining light on this terrible reality for other victims. I’m blessed to be in this position and forever grateful for this team! I look forward to continuing the journey of making this bill a law,” said Kaylin Hayman, a survivor and victim advocate, and former Disney child actor.
“Right now, there is a gap in California Law,” said Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko. “Changes need to be made to keep up with the quickly changing technology. This is a serious, prurient, and very disturbing problem that the law needs to address.”
“Confronting an unprecedented epidemic of social media-facilitated teen suicides, we urgently need to ensure that our criminal statutes against abusing or endangering children clearly reach the sickening and public sexualization of their appearances,” said Ed Howard, Senior Counsel, Children’s Advocacy Institute, University of San Diego School of Law.
""Common Sense Media applauds Assemblymember Berman's efforts to safeguard children online with the introduction of this bill, AB 1831, which builds on the success of AB 1394, a bill that was signed into law last year to help stamp out the deeply harmful problem of online child sex trafficking. This new bill employs a similarly proactive approach, this time protecting kids and teens against online exploitation that is exacerbated by the rise of AI. California should take the lead when it comes to protecting kids and families from the negative impacts of this powerful new technology,” said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO, Common Sense Media.
AB 1831 is co-sponsored by Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko, the California District Attorneys Association, Common Sense Media, SAG-AFTRA, and University of San Diego School of Law Children’s Advocacy Institute. The bill now goes to the State Senate Committee on Public Safety.

Marc Berman,Bill to Provide Free Tuition at Local Community Colleges Passes Assembly,2024-05-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today the Assembly overwhelmingly passed AB 3158, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will enable West Valley-Mission Community College District (WVMCCD) to waive tuition fees for all students living in its service area.
“Today’s bipartisan vote for AB 3158 is a huge win for all students of the West Valley-Mission Community College District, bringing us one step closer to free tuition for all,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Two-thirds of California’s community college students struggle with basic needs insecurities such as food and housing, a reality mirrored in WVMCCD’s student population. In my district in particular, the soaring costs of living pose a steep hurdle for local community college students.”
“AB 3158 gives our local community college district the authority to put significant financial resources back into students’ pockets, ensuring they don’t have to choose between taking the extra class they need to graduate or working an extra shift so they can afford groceries or pay rent. I applaud the leadership at West Valley-Mission Community College District for doing everything they can to support their students as they achieve their higher education dreams,” continued Assemblymember Berman.
Addressing the impacts of the Bay Area's astronomical cost of living, AB 3158 will alleviate the burden of state-mandated tuition fees. WVMCCD, funded through local property taxes, has successfully balanced its budget in recent years without imposing student fees. This was achieved through the District’s College Promise Scholarship. Chancellor Bradley Davis shared that while over 5,000 students have enrolled in the program, this bill is needed to simplify the process and dramatically expand free tuition access.
“While our Promise Program has been a huge step in the right direction, making it operational has been a complex and costly endeavor. This bill will streamline the process, making free education a reality and empowering our staff to focus on what they do best: nurturing the minds and talents of our students,” Chancellor Davis said.
West Valley College Student Trustee Melanie Ho shares, ""Because of the soaring costs of living in the Bay Area, many students are trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck.” By increasing access, Ho notes that this bill will “ease financial strain and foster a more equitable learning environment.”
Expanding access to free education is not just a boon for students; it's an investment in the community. Studies indicate that higher education correlates with increased economic activity, reduced crime rates, and enhanced civic engagement. By fostering an educated workforce, this bill is poised to yield long-term benefits for the local economy and community well-being.
Board President Anne Kepner adds, “In an effort to eliminate barriers preventing students from achieving their educational goals, the Board recently allocated resources to waive student health and parking fees, provide free childcare for students, and have approved a pilot program to waive tuition for students living in our service area. We are grateful to Assemblymember Marc Berman for championing a bill allowing us to expand our free tuition program.”
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic, WVMCCD has seen a resurgence in overall enrollment. With new bachelor’s degrees and workforce development programs on the horizon, the District is set to broaden its impact with more comprehensive educational pathways.
“This bill comes during a renaissance of opportunity for our district, underscoring our commitment to inclusivity and educational enrichment. It is a testament to our belief that unrestricted access to education is a fundamental right, pivotal in unlocking every student's potential,” shared Chancellor Davis.
AB 3158 is sponsored by West Valley-Mission Community College District and has support from local legislators. State Senators Josh Becker and Dave Cortese are principal co-authors and Assemblymember Evan Low and Gail Pellerin are co-authors.

Marc Berman,Bipartisan Retail Theft Package Advances,2024-05-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Assembly passed AB 3209, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Salinas), which will authorize a court to impose a Retail Crime Restraining Order upon conviction, or following two or more citations, for a theft offense, vandalism within the store, or battery on an employee within the store. AB 3209 is a key provision in the Assembly’s bipartisan legislative package addressing retail crime and theft in California.
“Whether it be at large retailers at Stanford Shopping Center or small businesses in our unique downtowns, the Bay Area has experienced the largest increases in shoplifting rates across California in the last few years. Whether you’re working at a local store, or shopping there, you deserve to feel safe,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “AB 3209 will give local law enforcement an additional and needed enforcement tool against retail crimes, and will further discourage organized and repeated retail theft. This bill, which received significant bipartisan support today, is a key component of the Assembly’s comprehensive retail theft legislative package. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to promote legislative solutions to reduce retail crime and theft in California in a smart, thoughtful way.”
AB 3209 is supported by Attorney General Rob Bonta, the California Retailers Association, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the League of California Cities.
The Assembly’s bipartisan retail theft legislative package will deliver new tools for California to strengthen public safety and protect shoppers and operators. Learn more about the full package of bills here.
Recent trends in retail theft and commercial robbery vary notably throughout the state. The Bay Area experienced the largest increases in shoplifting rates. In regards to shoplifting, San Mateo and San Francisco counties had the highest rates in 2022 seeing increases of 53 percent and 24 percent compared to 2019. There are also substantial increases in commercial burglaries and robberies. For commercial burglary, some counties saw an increase of more than 50 percent in 2022 compared to 2019. For commercial robberies, Los Angeles County had the highest rate along with Fresno and Sacramento counties that saw a 51 percent and 29 percent increase compared to 2019.
The growing issue of retail theft and robbery as well as vandalism and assault on employees in retail must be addressed to ensure the safety of our communities and businesses. In 2023, the California State Assembly established a Select Committee on Retail Theft to further examine this problem and seek thoughtful solutions that do not create undue hardship to our communities. A retail crime restraining order is one of these solutions that provides a balance in providing enforcement tools for retail crimes while implementing a reasonable restriction that does not exacerbate the underlying issues of poverty.

Marc Berman,Berman Bill to Develop Nation-Leading Plan to Decarbonize California’s Manufacturing Sector Clears Assembly,2024-05-21,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the passage of his green manufacturing proposal through the Assembly. The bill will create a centralized plan to decarbonize California’s vital manufacturing sector. AB 2083 is a pivotal first step to drive innovation and funding for the inevitable shift to clean manufacturing and ensure California’s continued leadership for years to come. 
“Last July was the world's hottest month on record, the hottest in 120,000 years, and the worst is yet to come. While California continues to be a global leader in addressing the climate crisis, our Earth depends on us doing much more,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Industrial emissions are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state and have largely remained unaddressed. That’s why we need AB 2083 to guide California’s historically hard-to-decarbonize industrial sector to a zero emission future.”
Industrial emissions from California’s manufacturing facilities make up 23% of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, the largest source after transportation. Unfortunately, industrial emissions have remained flat or even risen in recent years, with these same sources also emitting large quantities of air pollution that disproportionately impacts environmental justice communities. Without a roadmap, California will have no clear plan or strategy to decarbonize the industrial sector to meet its 2030 or 2045 GHG emissions targets. 
“As a world leader in manufacturing, California has a critical opportunity to support our businesses and protect our lungs by devising a plan to modernize manufacturing facilities across the state,” said Adrian Martinez, Deputy Managing Attorney of Earthjustice’s Right To Zero campaign. “By developing a clear plan to reduce emissions, we can both support this vital sector of our economy and curb a major source of pollution at the same time.”
“Many of the solutions we need to clean up emissions from California’s industrial sector are already widely available,” said Evan Gillespie, Partner at Industrious Labs. “California businesses are already using electric ovens and heat pumps to mass produce food and other goods. They’re beginning to deploy thermal energy storage to provide high temperature, zero-emissions heat. By developing a clear plan to decarbonize now, we can help all of our state’s manufacturers find incentives and solutions to upgrade their equipment to zero-emissions technologies.”
AB 2083 would require that the California Energy Commission prepare a report that assesses the potential for the state to reduce GHG emissions in the state’s industrial facilities’ heat application equipment and processes by at least 85 percent below 1990 levels by January 1, 2045. By cutting pollution from industrial facilities, the roadmap will deliver tangible health benefits for overburdened communities, while also providing California’s valued manufacturing businesses with the funding assistance and market certainty they need for sustained economic growth.
“As the largest area in the country for manufacturing, AB 2083 is critical to ensuring that Southern California can continue to lead in providing good job prospects and innovative solutions which are vital for protecting communities all while keeping the economy humming,"" said Marven E. Norman, Policy Coordinator at the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice. 
“Manufacturing industries are critical to our economy, but we don’t have to choose between supporting these industries and improving our air quality,” said Kevin Hamilton, Founder of the Central California Asthma Collaborative. ”AB 2083 ensures a plan is created to map the pathway to help manufacturers transition to readily available zero emissions technologies and clean up that pollution once and for all.""
“California is falling behind in reaching our landmark climate goals, and industrial emissions make up nearly a quarter of our state's climate pollution,” said Gabriela Facio, California Policy Strategist at the Sierra Club. “It’s time for the Golden State to develop a plan to modernize manufacturing with zero-emissions technologies across the state. Passing AB 2083 is crucial to securing federal funding opportunities, facilitating a just transition in an important sector of California’s economy, and maintaining our leadership on climate.""

Marc Berman,Senator Becker and Assemblymember Berman Present Symbolic State Check to the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center,2024-04-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) presented the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center in Palo Alto with a ceremonial $300,000 check for funding secured by the Legislators in the state budget. The funding will support the PREP Fellowship Program, a local pilot program for teens who are preparing for college and are at risk of experiencing antisemitism. As antisemitism continues to skyrocket, this program will provide teens new tools to better prepare for their next chapter in life. 
“I'm proud to join Assemblymember Marc Berman to present a symbolic check to the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center's PREP Fellowship Program. This fellowship focuses on three main areas: wellness, living peacefully in community, and identity in the face of adversity. It teaches high school students of every background the skills to transition to adulthood and prepare them to navigate future challenges on college campuses or in other future endeavors, particularly when students are at risk of being discriminated against,” said Senator Becker (D-Menlo Park), Vice Chair, California Legislative Jewish Caucus.
“Jews represent approximately 3% of the California population but, according to CA Department of Justice data, 62.4% of religious based hate crimes in the state in 2022 were perpetrated against the Jewish community,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""Unfortunately, antisemitic attacks have only skyrocketed to historic levels in the last six months since the October 7th attacks, making it critical that we support local teens who are likely to face harassment and discrimination just for being Jewish. I am grateful to the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center for creating the PREP Fellowship Program, and I'm glad we were able to get funding for it in the state budget. This important program will help local students in developing resiliency, which is a crucial skill for all young people, and particularly vital as antisemitic incidents have dramatically increased on college campuses and in society.” 
""PREP Fellowship has provided me with invaluable skills, not only in advocacy and for my empowerment as a Jewish person, but also in every day conversations and internal conflicts. I learned how to communicate effectively. I learned how to recognize bias. These are all extremely valuable tools for life, of course. However, at the end of the day, change begins with a person, and for that person to create change, they must be a leader. This fellowship has taught me how to be that leader, and I look forward to creating that change in my lifetime,"" said Noam Lazarov, PREP Fellowship participant.
“When we envisioned the PREP Fellowship program last spring, we knew we were onto something. The plan had been to run the program this spring, but then after October 7, our friends in the California Jewish Legislative Caucus encouraged us to move up the timeline and begin the program in November – and they were right. This program has been incredibly beneficial for high school juniors and seniors as they’re seeing the challenging situation on college campuses, wondering how they’ll fare, and then having their worries and concerns addressed by PREP. They’re coming away from our crash course with real life skills to deal with everything from mental distress and anxiety, conflict resolution and coalition building, to dealing with antisemitism and hate. We have helped train our next generation of leaders, and could not have done it without the support of the California State Legislature, starting with our friends in the California Jewish Legislative Caucus,” said Zack Bodner, President and CEO of the Oshman Family JCC.
“The PREP Fellowship is having a huge impact on the teens who are taking part. The focus of the program is on three competencies in particular: are learning how to have difficult conversations, including about antisemitism; learning how to stand up for what is important to them and to be leaders in their community; and learning how to recognize mental health issues in their peers and provide peer first aid. This cohort of teens is rising to these complicated challenges amazingly well, and we are so proud of them,” said Luba Palant, Senior Director of Culture, Learning & Community at the Oshman Family JCC.
The PREP Fellowship (Pride – Renewal – Education – Purpose) at the Oshman Family JCC is an ongoing, life-skills preparation program for high school juniors and seniors, aimed at helping them learn practical, applicable tools that will aid their transition when leaving home for college, the workforce and/or a gap year. The fellowship focuses on three main areas: wellness, living peacefully in community and identity in the face of adversity. Over the course of seven months, participants gather as a cohort for ten workshops and one spring retreat, during which they engage with a lineup of expert educators and professionals from Bay Area and national partner organizations. Fellows explore how to grow and confidently express their own unique and group identities, whether Jewish or any other identity, on college campuses or elsewhere in the world beyond their home, particularly when at risk of being marginalized or discriminated against for who they are.
 
The Oshman Family Jewish Community Center (OFJCC) on the Taube Koret Campus for Jewish Life serves the South Peninsula through educational, social, cultural, fitness, sports and other programs. The OFJCC is a multigenerational Jewish neighborhood where all are welcome, and which seeks to enrich lives, build community and inspire Jewish journeys. The OFJCC provides a common ground for individuals, Jewish institutions, and other local groups and organizations and individuals to work, learn, play and celebrate together for the betterment of the whole community.

Marc Berman,Berman’s Public Safety Package Advances,2024-04-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) advanced three bills focused on keeping California’s residents and businesses safe. AB 3209, AB 1831, and AB 1962 passed out of the Assembly Public Safety Committee with bipartisan support. All three bills respond to the new realities of 2024, with rising retail theft and a new frontier of crimes driven by the malicious use of advanced technology.
“Keeping Californians safe has always been a top priority of mine. The last few years have posed new safety challenges across our state, exposing loopholes and deficiencies in our laws that we must address. My district has been hit hard by increases in retail theft, with San Mateo County experiencing the highest rate of shoplifting of any county in 2022. In addition, my district is at the forefront of powerful, emergent technology which, in the wrong hands, can cause great harm to the most vulnerable among us. Whether you are posting pictures of your children on Facebook, or shopping at your favorite local businesses, Californians have a right to feel safe,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “I’m excited by the bipartisan support for these commonsense, smart on crime policies that will make our communities safer.”
Curbing the Tide of Retail Theft

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 3209 will authorize a court to impose a Retail Crime Restraining Order for a theft offense, vandalism within the store, or battery on an employee within the store. The bill is a key provision in the Assembly’s bipartisan legislative package addressing retail crime and theft. While retail theft has made headlines across the state, a recent report found that San Mateo County had the highest rate of shoplifting of any county in California in 2022.
“Like all Californians, my constituents are eager for real solutions to address retail theft, vandalism and assaults on store employees. A retail crime restraining order is a commonsense solution that provides a new enforcement tool against retail crimes,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 3209 will keep California’s stores and workers safe from crime while providing the flexibility needed to avoid exacerbating issues of poverty. I’m proud of the bipartisan support this bill has already received, and look forward to working with colleagues to pass a comprehensive package of bills to reduce retail crime and theft in California in a smart, thoughtful way.”
“Organized retail crime and theft are harming our communities, undermining business owners and eroding people’s confidence in law and order. That ends today. The Assembly’s bipartisan legislative package strengthens public safety and protects shoppers and operators. Our comprehensive and balanced solutions uphold the successful reforms we’ve enacted to institute a more just system, and also reflect my colleagues' thoughtful dedication to exploring every aspect of the issue,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas.
Protecting Children from Sexual Exploitation

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AB 1831 would criminalize the creation, distribution, and possession of artificial intelligence-generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). The bill aims to address the emerging challenges posed by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can produce disturbing and harmful content resembling actual children.
“California law must be crystal clear that the sexual exploitation of children is illegal, including when AI is used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM) that is virtually indistinguishable from a real child,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I want to thank Kaylin Hayman, a survivor and victim advocate, for sharing her experience as a Disney child actor who endured AI-generated sexual exploitation. Her testimony today is a heartbreaking example of why we must pass AB 1831 to ensure our children are protected. My gratitude also goes to Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko for first raising this issue with me, and for his powerful advocacy for survivors.”
“Right now, there is a gap in California Law,” said Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko. “Changes need to be made to keep up with the quickly changing technology. This is a serious, prurient, and very disturbing problem that the law needs to address.”
AB 1831 is co-sponsored by Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko, the California District Attorneys Association, Common Sense Media, SAG-AFTRA, and University of San Diego School of Law Children’s Advocacy Institute.
Cracking Down on Revenge Porn
AB 1962 closes a loophole in current law used by perpetrators to evade punishment for distributing private sexual images of another person, either photos or video, without their consent.
“Secretly taking pornographic photos or video of someone doesn’t make you cool. It makes you a coward. And when you get caught, you’ll get convicted,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Too often perpetrators of revenge porn leverage legal loopholes to get away with this heinous crime, leaving victims traumatized, humiliated, and without justice. AB 1962 will ensure that if you record and distribute another person’s sexually explicit images without their consent there will be legal consequences.”
“Revenge porn is not sexy. It’s not acceptable. It’s not legal. It’s a felony. If you secretly record sexual images of someone else and post them online one of your hits may be law enforcement. And we will prosecute you,” said Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen.
Existing law does not prevent someone from secretly recording an explicit video or taking an explicit picture for the purpose of revenge, which can often be the motivation behind revenge porn. It also does not cover circumstances where a person distributes stolen videos or images. AB 1962 makes it clear that these actions are illegal.
Revenge porn is an increasingly common crime intended to shame and intimidate its victims. Victims often suffer additional harm such as threats of physical violence, stalking, and criminal threats.[1] A study by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative found that 93% of victims suffered significant emotional distress because of their victimization, 51% had suicidal thoughts, and 49% stated they had been stalked or harassed online by users who saw their explicit images.[2]

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Marc Berman Unveils Safety Reforms to School Zones in California,2024-03-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) unveiled legislation at Castlemont Elementary School in Campbell to improve safety in school zones for all Californians. AB 2583 will align California with the majority of other states by using clearer and easier-to-comply-with, time-based standards for school zones speed limits, rather than “when children are present.” Additionally, the bill would lower speed limits in school zones to 20 mph or less and improve safety-oriented planning within half a mile of schools.
“I’ve heard from too many parents concerned about close calls in front of schools or, tragically, kids being hit by cars and seriously injured or even killed. We must take action to prioritize the safety of every child walking and biking to school,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “The Safer School Zones Act will lower speeds, increase speed limit compliance, and elevate planning for safe school zones.”
“Research shows that reducing speed limits in school zones brings significant safety benefits,” continued Assemblymember Berman. “But lowering speeds alone isn’t enough. Our current school zone policies are confusing for drivers to follow and hard for public safety officials to enforce. School zones should be safe havens for all students, parents, teachers, and school employees.”
“Streets for All is proud to work with Assemblymember Marc Berman on this urgent and lifesaving bill, as traffic violence is the #1 killer of children in California. Our school zones should be a safe haven from that violence instead of a contributor. AB 2583 will save lives by creating a better standard than the ambiguous ‘when children are present’ signs and will lower speeds all of which ultimately save the lives of children, parents, and caretakers on our roads,” said Kirsten Bladh, Associate Director of State Policy, Streets for All.

Supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics - CA, AB 2583 advances policies that create safe, healthy, and equitable school zones so that all kids feel safe walking or biking to school, and are protected from speeding cars on roads designed for drivers, rather than people. Last year the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended reducing speed limits to 20 mph or less to improve child pedestrian safety. California’s school zones policies are a national outlier. Of the 39 states that set a maximum school zone speed by statute, California is one of just nine states with a school zone speed limit greater than 20 mph. Only six other states mandate the use of “when children are present.” A time-based standard is easier for drivers to comply with because it provides a statewide, consistent, and easy-to-understand parameter to follow. “When children are present” offers no protection to teachers, parents, school employees, or any other adults who travel to and from schools. A report by Smart Growth America and the National Complete Streets Coalition ranked California in the top ten most dangerous states for pedestrians between 2016 to 2020.
The average risk of severe injury for a pedestrian struck by a vehicle reaches 10% at an impact speed of 16 mph and 25% at 23 mph, which is an increase of 250%. Risk of death at 15 mph is 4%, while the risk at 25 mph is 12% (a 300% increase). One out of 10 pedestrians struck by a vehicle traveling at 40 mph will survive, but 9 out of 10 pedestrians will survive when a vehicle is traveling at 20 mph. Research shows that up to 72% of children injured as pedestrians will have functional limitations 6 months after their injury.
At lower speeds, drivers can see more of their surroundings and have more time to see and react to potential hazards. A 2016 study from Safe Kids Worldwide titled “Alarming Dangers in School Zones” found, “lower speed limits also reduced the likelihood of unsafe driver behavior.” Distracted driving was more likely during afternoon pick-up and in school zones where the speed limit was more than 20 mph.

Marc Berman,Democracy Leaders Introduce Solutions to Curb Emerging Digital Threats,2024-03-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — Today, Assemblymember Berman (D-Menlo Park) joined key legislators and the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy (CITED), a project of California Common Cause, to announce package of bills to regulate the dangers that AI, deepfakes, and disinformation pose to our democracy. Together, these democracy leaders aim to take the first steps in meaningfully protecting California’s democracy and voters from one of its current greatest threats: disinformation turbocharged by generative AI and deepfakes.
“AB 2655 will ensure that online platforms restrict the spread of election-related deceptive deepfakes meant to prevent voters from voting or to deceive them based on fraudulent content,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous tool in the arsenal of those that want to wage disinformation campaigns, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on our democracy by attributing speech and conduct to a person that is false or that never happened. Advances in AI make it easy for practically anyone to generate this deceptive content, making it that much more important that we identify and restrict its spread before it has the chance to deceive voters and undermine our democracy.""
“AI and disinformation are an existential threat to our democracy, and we’ve reached a point of no return. Now is the time to act,” said Jonathan Mehta Stein, California Common Cause’s executive director. “Using an unbiased, independent, interdisciplinary approach, CITED and our legislative partners have developed a legislative agenda that gets at the heart of what is shaping up to be one of the great issues of our lifetime, while upholding free speech and respecting technological innovation.”

CITED’s 2024 legislative package includes:
“Foreign adversaries hope to harness new and powerful technology to misinform and divide America this election cycle,” said Senator Steve Padilla. “Bad actors and foreign bots now have the ability to create fake videos and images and spread lies to millions at the touch of a button. We need to ensure our content platforms protect against the kind of malicious interference that we know is possible. Verifying the identities of accounts with large followings allows us to weed out those that seek to corrupt our information stream.”
“There have always been bad actors who try to wreak havoc on elections. I remember an election where people distributed door hangers which gave people the wrong polling location in order to disrupt the election outcome. But now the widespread access to generative AI is making that type of damage so much more sophisticated and easier to disseminate,” said Assemblymember Gail Pellerin. “Getting the right information to voters is crucial to a functioning democracy, and it becomes very difficult to ensure the integrity of the election when these deepfakes are spread online to intentionally misinform voters.”
Since 2020, voters have seen disinformation pollute our politics more than ever, and now with AI-generated deepfakes becoming a routine part of our information ecosystems, the issue is rapidly intensifying. We have already seen deepfakes destabilizing national elections in Argentina, Slovakia, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and the US presidential primary. Just as this problem is peaking, many technology and social media platforms are decreasing their investments in their trust and safety teams and walking away from any responsibility to address it. Voters are now left to pick up the pieces, not knowing what images, audio, and video they can trust.
CITED’s work has been informed by research and thought leadership from titans in tech, law, public policy, civil rights, civic engagement, and academia, and influenced by successes and emerging ideas from the European Union, the White House, Congress, and states around the country. Independent of industry and with bipartisan leadership, CITED provides analysis and guidance divorced from private agendas and partisanship.

Marc Berman,Mountain View High School Student Inspires Berman Bill,2024-02-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the introduction of AB 2668, which provides health insurance coverage for wigs or hairpieces for Californians experiencing medical hair loss due to health conditions, including alopecia areata.
“I’m so grateful to Miranda and her peers for sharing their stories about the benefit that wigs had in helping them reclaim their confidence and identity, and the critical role wigs play in self-esteem and mental health,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I am honored to partner with them to author AB 2668 to ensure that Californians who have alopecia areata or other medical hair loss have access to wigs as part of their treatment. I commend their courage to speak up and raise awareness to the lack of health insurance coverage for such a vital treatment.”
“Hair is never just hair. We wear it like clothes, and it is a part of our identity. I have alopecia areata and my self-esteem continues to be impacted when bald patches appear. Often, I resent seeing myself in family photos, and through competitive dance, attention to my lack of hair is heightened,” said Miranda Huang, a Mountain View High School student with alopecia areata. “A wig is important because it enables me to feel confident in my skin and not be reduced by a disease’s label. Californians with medical hair loss need this bill and I thank Assemblymember Berman for authoring it.”
""Hair is a critical part of how we think of ourselves and express ourselves to the world. When patients lose their hair to alopecia areata, they often tell me they no longer recognize themselves in the mirror,” said Dr. Jennifer Fu, UCSF Dermatologist. “Too often, our school-aged patients are bullied at school, become socially isolated, and withdraw from previously loved extracurricular activities. The burden of this disease, its psychosocial consequences and economic impact, can be devastating.""
“I have been dealing with alopecia for the past 14 years. I was diagnosed with this condition when I was just three years old, and ever since then, it has been a rollercoaster ride for me. It was challenging to cope with this physical change at such a young age, significantly impacting my self-esteem. Over the last 15 years, I have tried multiple treatments for my alopecia. It was frustrating to go through various medications and procedures only to find temporary or minimal success. All this significantly impacted my academic life, and I consider it a victory that I kept my academics focused despite these severe distractions. This experience showed me that although alopecia may not be life-threatening, it brings immense social, physical, and mental strain to patients, leading to many mental health issues. One of the struggles I faced was the cost of alopecia wigs. These wigs, often necessary for patients like me, are expensive. Additionally, insurance coverage is not applicable for wigs for alopecia, even though they are covered for other more established situations such as chemotherapy. The healthcare system's high costs and lack of support for alopecia patients exacerbate our challenges in finding solutions,” said Saratoga-based Monta Vista High School student Mihir Sharma.
“When I first lost my hair, I was terrified of looking different. I had heard that good wigs cost lots of money,” said Georgia Van Cuylenburg, a Los Angeles resident with alopecia areata. “A year later, my parents helped me with the cost of the wig and I was able to get a wig that looked like my old hair. I cried when I saw myself in the mirror for the first time – I looked like me again. Had it been possible that the wig could have been covered by my insurance maybe I would have got this wig much sooner.”
Sponsored by the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, AB 2668 would provide coverage for a wig if a licensed provider prescribes the wig for treatment for a diagnosed health condition, chronic illness, or injury, including but not limited to alopecia areata. The bill would limit coverage to no more than one wig in a year and limit the amount to $750. The cost of wigs depend on a number of factors including length and the average cost is approximately $1,500.
Currently, seven states provide coverage for wigs. Minnesota and New Hampshire specifically provide coverage for individuals with alopecia areata. Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island provide coverage for individuals with cancer.
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss. People with alopecia areata most often lose hair in circular, coin-sized patches on the scalp, but in more severe cases, they may lose all of their hair. About 700,000 people in the U.S. currently have some form of alopecia areata, with 80,000 in California alone. Although alopecia areata can begin at any age, individuals often develop the disease early in life. In fact, 40% of individuals experience symptoms by age 20. Research suggests that women are more likely to develop alopecia areata than men. Several U.S.-based studies found the odds of developing alopecia areata were higher among Asian, Black, and Hispanic individuals than among white individuals. Some of the most common emotions associated with having alopecia areata include loneliness, withdrawal, isolation, loss and grief, sadness (which can lead to depression), confusion, denial, stress, anger, hopelessness, embarrassment, fear, and guilt or self-blame.

Marc Berman,Berman Unveils Legislation for Free Tuition at WVMCCD,2024-02-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – This past Friday, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 3158, legislation enabling West Valley-Mission Community College District (WVMCCD) to waive tuition fees for all students living in its service area. This bill builds on the successes of the San Mateo County Community College District’s Free Tuition program, which was supported by Berman.
“I am excited to join forces with West Valley-Mission Community College District to eliminate tuition fees for their students,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Two-thirds of California’s community college students struggle with basic needs insecurities such as food and housing, a reality mirrored in WVMCCD’s student population.”
“AB 3158 gives our local community college district the authority to put significant financial resources back into students’ pockets, ensuring they don’t have to choose between taking the extra class they need or affording groceries or rent. I applaud the leadership at West Valley-Mission Community College District for doing everything they can to support their students to achieve their higher education dreams,” continued Assemblymember Berman.
Addressing the Bay Area's escalating living costs, this legislation aims to alleviate the burden of state-mandated tuition fees. WVMCCD, funded through local property taxes, has successfully balanced its budget in recent years without imposing student fees. This was achieved through the District’s College Promise Scholarship.
Chancellor Bradley Davis shared that while over 5,000 students have enrolled in the program, operationally it has proven challenging for students and staff. This bill will simplify the process and dramatically expand free tuition access.
“While our Promise Program has been a huge step in the right direction, making it operational has been a complex and costly endeavor. This bill will streamline the process, making free education a reality and empowering our staff to focus on what they do best: nurturing the minds and talents of our students,” Chancellor Davis said.
West Valley College Student Trustee Melanie Ho shares, ""Because of the soaring costs of living in the Bay Area, many students are trapped in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck.” By increasing access, Ho notes that this bill will “ease financial strain and foster a more equitable learning environment.”
However, expanding access to free education is not just a boon for students; it's an investment in the community. Studies indicate that higher education correlates with increased economic activity, reduced crime rates, and enhanced civic engagement. By fostering an educated workforce, this bill is poised to yield long-term benefits for the local economy and community well-being.
Board President Anne Kepner adds, “In an effort to eliminate barriers preventing students from achieving their educational goals, the Board recently allocated resources to waive student health and parking fees, provide free childcare for students, and have approved a pilot program to waive tuition for students living in our service area. We are grateful Assemblymember Marc Berman will champion a bill allowing us to expand our free tuition program.”
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic, WVMCCD has seen a resurgence in overall enrollment. With new bachelor’s degrees and workforce development programs on the horizon, the District is set to broaden its impact with more comprehensive educational pathways.
“This bill comes during a renaissance of opportunity for our district, underscoring our commitment to inclusivity and educational enrichment. It is a testament to our belief that unrestricted access to education is a fundamental right, pivotal in unlocking every student's potential,” shared Chancellor Davis.
AB 3158 is sponsored by West Valley-Mission Community College District and has support from local legislators. State Senator Josh Becker is a principal co-author and Assemblymember Evan Low and Gail Pellerin are co-authors.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Combat Voter Intimidation,2024-02-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 2642, the Protecting Elections from Armed Coercion and Extremism Act (PEACE Act). AB 2642 strengthens safeguards allowing voters to cast their ballot free from interference and intimidation. The bill updates existing anti-intimidation laws passed under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for the current era of increased gun violence and election denialism by recognizing that the presence of guns in proximity to elections can be presumptively intimidating.
“In an era when our nation faces an epidemic of gun violence, as well as escalating election denialism and threats to elections officials and volunteers, we must prepare for the worst and continue to strengthen our election security and accessibility,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “The PEACE Act creates a first-in-the-nation policy to protect both voters and election workers. AB 2642 makes it clear that the polling place is not the place for guns, and ensures that Californians have the freedom to vote without fear of intimidation or harassment.”
""Elections have historically been safe havens from gun violence, but violent rhetoric and conspiracy theories around voting threaten to jeopardize that peace. For decades, California has led the nation on gun violence prevention and has the opportunity to lead again. The state can protect brave civil servants and voters from the type of extremism and violent actions witnessed across the country in the last few election cycles."" Allison Anderman, attorney working with GIFFORDS Law Center.
""Every eligible American is guaranteed the right to vote in peace, free from intimidation. With voting already underway in 2024, this commonsense legislation would make California a leader in safeguarding that right. It strengthens the ability of voters and election workers to protect themselves from intimidation in the courts. And it reaffirms the genuine risk to voting rights posed by the presence of guns near our elections."" Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the Brennan Center for Justice's voting rights program.
AB 2642 would establish a presumption that a person openly carrying a firearm while engaging in election-related activities is also engaging in voter intimidation. This bill would provide civil remedies for individuals who experience this type of intimidation, thereby supplementing the existing criminal prohibitions of intimidation. A nationwide poll conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice found that over half of election workers are concerned that threats, harassment, and intimidation may harm retention and recruitment efforts. Additionally, 30% admitted personally experiencing abuse, harassment, or threats due to their role as local election officials. In California, 44% of Californians will see a different election administrator in 2024 than the one who administered the 2020 election.[1] These statistics highlight the turnover and concerns surrounding harassment faced by election workers, even with existing criminal prohibitions. Strengthening these protections is crucial to ensure the safety and freedom of our elections.
The United States Supreme court has emphasized that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is not a regulatory straightjacket.[2] The Second Amendment allows for a “variety of gun regulations,”[3] and the Court has consistently recognized that states have the authority to restrict the carrying of firearms in “sensitive places,” including schools, government buildings, legislative assemblies, polling places, and courthouses.[4]

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Marc Berman and Superintendent of Public Instruction Thurmond Unveil AB 2097 to Guarantee Access to Computer Science for All California Students,2024-02-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond unveiled legislation to expand access to computer science education in California by requiring that all public high schools in California offer at least one computer science education course. The bill, AB 2097, also establishes computer science as a high school graduation requirement by the 2030-31 school year.
“It is critical to equip our students with the skills they need to enter the 21st century workforce and succeed in our digitally driven world,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Computer science skills are needed in many career fields, from science and technology to agriculture, entertainment, fashion, banking, marketing, and beyond. We owe it to our students to teach them the fundamental skills they need to succeed in tomorrow’s economy – and that starts with having access to a computer science education.” 
“Even in Silicon Valley, too many students who grow up in the shadows of global tech companies are not gaining the skills they need to one day work at those companies. Not only will AB 2097 help provide the workforce needed for California to remain competitive with other states and other nations, but it is also crucial in closing the existing gender and diversity gaps. If we truly value equity in our schools, we need to ensure all students have access to computer science education,” continued Assemblymember Berman.
“I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to make computer science a high school graduation requirement in the state of California. It is necessary that we equip our young people with the essential skills needed to thrive in careers of today and tomorrow. Our state has long been the home of some of the greatest technology founders and innovators, and all of our students should be empowered to contribute to and benefit from that success. Computer science is foundational and imperative for all of our students to become productive, responsible digital citizens in a global society,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.
State Senator Josh Becker and Assemblymember Lori Wilson are principal coauthors of AB 2097.
Despite being the undisputed cradle of innovation, California has for too long failed to offer students from all backgrounds access to computer science courses, falling well behind 40 states and leaving a growing equity gap.
As of January 2023, California has 45,245 open computing jobs that have an average salary of $153,544, yet there were only 9,339 graduates in computer science in 2020. California has the highest number of open computing jobs in the country.
“Many students have no idea what they can do with computer science skills until they take my classes and realize how many doors start to open up,” said Modesto Computer Science Teacher Amy Pezzoni. “As a teacher, I love creating opportunities for my students to learn skills that will really serve them throughout their lives. We need to demystify computer science and embrace the fact that having skills in this field will serve our students in almost any job that they seek. That’s why we need to ensure that every student has access to these classes, regardless of where they are from.”

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Joint-Authors Bill to Halt California Public Utilities Commission’s Proposed Income-Graduated Fee,2024-01-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) signed on as a joint-author of Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin’s (D-Thousand Oaks) bill, AB 1999, that would repeal the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) proposed income-graduated fixed fee. Assemblymember Berman spoke at a press conference announcing the repeal this morning.
“My constituents are fed up, and so am I,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Utility rates continue to rise and accountability continues to fall. The outrageous proposals from PG&E and the other investor-owned utilities (IOUs) disproportionately burden Californians living in high-cost areas like my district.”
“We need to double down on policies that incentivize energy conservation and rooftop solar, and stand up to a CPUC that continues to rubber stamp rate increases pushed by the IOUs. This charge would have disincentivized energy conservation and cut a break to some of the biggest energy users while penalizing smaller, energy efficient homes and working-class Californians.”
The CPUC has had the authority to implement a fixed rate charge, up to $10 a month, since 2015, but has declined to do so.
Last year Assemblymember Berman joined a working group comprised of Assemblymembers who shared concerns about the merits of the proposed fixed, income-graduated rate. As part of the working group, Assemblymember Berman met with key stakeholders in the Governor’ office, the CPUC, utilities, and with the solar industry. The working group sent a letter to the CPUC outlining their concerns with the proposal which can be found below.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Outlaw Child Sexual Abuse Images Generated by AI,2024-01-16,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced AB 1831, which will criminalize the creation, distribution, and possession of artificial intelligence-generated Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). The bill aims to address the emerging challenges posed by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can produce disturbing and harmful content resembling actual children.
“The sexual exploitation of children must be illegal, full stop. It should not matter that the images were generated by AI, which is being used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM) that is virtually indistinguishable from a real child,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “We must stop the exploitation of children. It is critical that our laws keep up with rapidly evolving AI technology to ensure predators are being prosecuted and children are being protected.”
“Safeguarding our children from potential abusive or exploitative practices is imperative, and as new technologies present new challenges, we must do everything we can to ensure their safety in an ever changing world,” said SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles Local President Jodi Long. “We are deeply concerned by the threat of computer-generated and artificial intelligence generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and this legislation is an important step to preventing these dangerous practices.”
Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko, a cosponsor of the bill stated, “As technology evolves, so must our laws. This bill sends a clear message that our society will not tolerate the malicious use of artificial intelligence to produce harmful sexual content involving minors.”
“Confronting an unprecedented epidemic of social media-facilitated teen suicides, we urgently need to ensure that our criminal statutes against abusing or endangering children clearly reach the sickening and public sexualization of their appearances,” said Ed Howard, Senior Counsel, Children’s Advocacy Institute, University of San Diego School of Law.
""Common Sense Media applauds Assemblymember Berman's efforts to safeguard children online with the introduction of this bill, AB 1831, which builds on the success of AB 1394, a bill that was signed into law last year to help stamp out the deeply harmful problem of online child sex trafficking. This new bill employs a similarly proactive approach, this time protecting kids and teens against online exploitation that is exacerbated by the rise of AI. California should take the lead when it comes to protecting kids and families from the negative impacts of this powerful new technology,” said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO, Common Sense Media.
Existing law prohibits the manufacture, distribution, and possession of CSAM depicting an actual child. It does not address computer-generated images that depict the likeness of a child, even those that are virtually indistinguishable from an actual child, or those that are computer-generated to look like a known child or child celebrity. AB 1831 would prohibit the creation and possession of obscene CSAM images generated by artificial intelligence.
CSAM is a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor. Research has shown a correlation between the consumption of CSAM and an increased risk of individuals engaging in hands-on sexual offenses against minors.[1] Viewing and possessing such material can contribute to desensitization and may escalate criminal behavior. Additionally, a recent study revealed that machine-learning models were trained on datasets containing thousands of depictions of known CSAM victims, revictimizing the children by using their likeness to generate AI CSAM images into perpetuity.[2]

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Reacts to Governor Newsom’s Budget Proposal,2024-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) issued the following statement in response to Governor Newsom’s January budget proposal:
“The Governor’s January budget proposal reflects the new budgetary reality: lower than anticipated revenues mean difficult decisions must be made. However, in anticipation of an inevitable downturn, we have diligently prepared for leaner times, accumulating record level budget reserves that will allow us to adopt a budget that protects the gains we’ve made over the last decade. I applaud the Governor for his work to introduce a balanced budget that preserves funding for key commitments such as homelessness, mental health, schools, and safer communities during these challenging times,” said Assemblymember Berman.
“I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration over the next several months to negotiate and finalize the state budget, with a focus on both equity and fiscal prudence. We have hard work ahead of us to continue to make progress on California’s most pressing challenges.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws",2023-12-19,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) authored twelve new laws that take effect in 2024. The legislation includes his first-in-the-nation phase out of gas-powered small off-road engines such as leaf blowers and lawn mowers and his transformative higher education reforms.
“2024 is an important year for the implementation of some of the most impactful bills I’ve authored during my tenure in the Assembly,” said Assemblymember Berman. “My landmark environmental bill, AB 1346, which made California the first state to phase out the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment, takes effect in January 1, 2024. Higher education students will see some of the biggest reforms as a host of policies to boost student success will take effect next year. In addition, 2024 will also bring a number of timely new laws focused on addressing some of the biggest issues of our time, including ending gun violence, improving elections security and accessibility, and capping prescription costs.”
Unless otherwise stated, all laws go into effect on January 1st, 2024:
Environment
Assembly Bill 1346 phases out the sale of highly polluting small gas-powered engines such as leaf blowers and lawn mowers beginning in 2024. Assemblymember Berman secured $30 million in state funding to ease the transition to zero emission equipment for small landscaping businesses.
“Leaf blowers, lawn mowers, and other equipment with small gas-powered engines emit staggering levels of air pollution,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “These noisy machines are terribly disruptive to communities across California, and the workers who breathe in exhaust from this equipment day in and day out face disproportionate health risks, including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. To support an equitable transition to safer, cleaner equipment, we secured $30 million in state funding to help small businesses purchase zero-emission replacements.”
Elections
Assembly Bill 1539 prohibits a person from voting in both California and another state in elections that occur on the same day.
Assembly Bill 1219 updates and improves the ballot design for voters while providing county elections officials with additional flexibility to reflect the diversity of counties and election systems.
Assembly Bill 1037 authorizes county elections officials to offer the option for California voters to fix or cure their Vote by Mail ballot electronically if the elections official determines that the signature does not match, or if the ballot envelope lacks a signature. The authorization takes effect in 2024, but the implementation timing is at the discretion of counties.
Gun Violence Prevention
Assembly Bill 1420 will ensure the California DOJ has the authority and tools necessary to adequately enforce any violations relating to the governing of the sale, transfer, and storage of firearms.
Higher Education
Assembly Bill 789, which takes effect at the start of the 2024–25 academic year, enables students to continue their education by removing barriers to keeping their financial aid and creating uniformity and transparency for students to appeal the loss of financial aid. The law ensures that postsecondary institutions across California do not impose requirements stricter than those required by federal law. It will also require that institutions consider a broader range of extenuating circumstances reflective of the student experience as a basis for an appeal to reinstate financial aid. Lastly, the bill creates a pathway for students who have disenrolled to regain aid upon re-enrollment.
Assembly Bill 928, the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act of 2021, transformed the transfer process in order to improve college affordability and increase access to higher education. On August, 1, 2024, a key provision of the law will take effect. This provision requires community colleges to place students who seek to transfer on an Associate Degree for Transfer pathway. The Associate Degree for Transfer guarantees admission to the CSU and participating independent non-profit universities. In addition, once students transfer, they only need to complete 60 units of coursework to earn a bachelor’s degree, saving students both time and money.
Assembly Bill 1111 requires, by July 1, 2024, that California Community Colleges adopt a student facing common course numbering system to ensure that comparable courses have the same course number at all community colleges. This law reduces unnecessary confusion, eases advising, reduces excess unit accumulation, and makes it easier for community college students to transfer and earn their degree.
Protecting Consumers
Assembly Bill 537, which takes effect on July 1, 2024, requires that mandatory hotel and resort fees be disclosed in the advertised, offered, and displayed room rates. The new law will crack down on hidden fees in the hotel industry – what President Biden termed “junk fees.”
Housing
Assembly Bill 2006 streamlines the oversight of affordable housing developments in California. The law requires the three state agencies which currently conduct oversight over affordable housing developments to enter into a memorandum of understanding to coordinate their compliance monitoring. The law, which was signed by Governor Newsom in 2022, takes effect on July 1 2024.
Health
Assembly Bill 948 will keep out-of-pocket drug costs low for consumers by permanently extending a prescription drug pricing cap and protections, which were set to expire next year. Without these critically important protections in place, consumers could once again pay thousands of dollars in one month alone for essential medication. This bill ensures our state will never again force Californians to go bankrupt when they need life-saving medication.
Assembly Bill 1130 will contribute to the reduction of stigma for individuals with substance use disorder by replacing outdated, pejorative terminology in our laws. The law updates provisions of code to replace the term “addict” with “person with substance use disorder.” This change is consistent with guidance from the National Institutes of Health to avoid terms that increase stigma and negative bias when discussing addiction.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Recognizes Computer Science Education Week,2023-12-04,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Luz Rivas (D-San Fernando Valley) recognized the week of December 4 as Computer Science Education Week in honor of Grace Hopper’s birthday on December 9. Grace Murray Hopper, one of the first women in the field of computer science, engineered new programming languages and pioneered standards for computer systems which laid the foundations for many advancements in computer science.
“Computer Science Education Week highlights the crucial role that computer science plays in equipping our students with the skills they need to succeed in tomorrow's digitally driven world,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Too many California students grow up in the shadows of California’s famous tech companies, yet go to schools that don’t even offer them the opportunity to learn the skills they need to one day work there. Expanding access to computer science courses will not only help close the gender and diversity gap in tech fields, it will also help train the future workforce needed for California to remain competitive both with other states and other nations.”
“During Computer Science Education Week, we are encouraging children with an interest in technology to fuel their passion. California is a global leader in technology and for youth yearning for exposure in this industry, and the career opportunities available to them are endless,” stated Assemblywoman Luz Rivas. “However, to ensure K-12 students are equipped with these essential 21st century skills, we must expand access to high-quality computer science courses. Expanding access to these classes statewide will continue to bolster and diversify California's leading tech industry.”
“Code.org is excited to celebrate Computer Science with Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week, which is an opportunity for students to receive a free introduction to computer science through fun activities and videos along with student peers around the world, while celebrating and promoting Computer Science Education Week,” said Code.org Director of Government Affairs, Codeye Woody.
Computer Science Education Week is an annual call to action to inspire K-12 students to learn computer science, advocate for equity in computer science education, and celebrate the contributions of students, teachers, and partners to the field.

Marc Berman,California Cracks Down on Hotel Junk Fees,2023-10-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation requiring that mandatory hotel and resort fees be disclosed in the advertised, offered, and displayed room rates. Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), the new law will crack down on hidden fees in the hotel industry – what President Biden termed “junk fees.” AB 537 builds upon SB 478 (Dodd), which was recently signed into law by the Governor and sets a baseline under California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act for advertising numerous consumer goods and services.
“Californians are fed up with surprise hotel charges, like cleaning or resort fees, that are both dishonest and misleading,” said Assemblymember Berman. “We’ve all had the experience of going to a hotel website, entering the dates of your stay, picking a room for a certain price, entering your personal information, and then at the very last step the hotel or travel website tacks on resort or cleaning fees. Earlier this year I was charged a destination fee at a hotel. It's a hotel. Being a destination isn’t a special add-on, it’s literally the essence of a hotel. Enough is enough. AB 537 will ensure that the advertised cost of your hotel stay is the real price you pay.”
“Reports show that U.S. hotels generate billions of dollars from mandatory hotel fees,” Berman added. “President Biden has made it clear: hidden fees, charges, and add-ons designed either to confuse or deceive consumers are unacceptable. Thank you to Governor Newsom for signing this important consumer protection legislation.”
“Internet lodging reservations should be honest and straightforward rather than a bait and switch trap door of price manipulation,” said Senator Steve Glazer, D-Contra Costa. “This legislation will ensure fair dealings for the traveling public.”
Senator Glazer authored a similar bill, SB 683, which would have required all lodging services, including hotels, short-term rentals, and third party booking services, to display the total cost of the stay including all extra fees, rather than just the “nightly” cost.
""The Consumer Federation of California is proud to sponsor AB 537 and thank Assemblymember Berman for taking the lead on this basic pocketbook issue,"" said Robert Herrell, Executive Director of the Consumer Federation of California. ""Resort fees are becoming more common, more expensive, and more troublesome by the day. Many companies manipulate consumers and their internet searches into thinking they're getting a better deal than they really are. That's why states and jurisdictions like Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. have taken bipartisan legal actions against these often-times hidden fees. Consumers should know what they're getting and the complete price from the moment they start looking. That's just common sense and basic consumer protection.""
Over the last few years, deceptive advertising in the short-term lodging industry has significantly increased, with many hotels, motels, and other short-term lodging establishments not disclosing mandatory fees in advance. Some hotels charge separate mandatory “resort fees” or “cleaning fees”, but fail to disclose them until later in the booking process (once most consumers have committed to the property) or at “checkout”. According to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times, at least one thousand of the 40,000 Airbnb listings included in the study charged a cleaning fee that was only $10 less than the nightly rate. The study also found that 83% of short-term rentals in Los Angeles charged a cleaning fee which typically ranged from $5 to $1,500, with one fee as much as $2,500. Furthermore, this report showed that in 2018, across the U.S., hotels generated approximately $3 billion in mandatory hotel fees, an 8.5% increase compared to 2017.

Marc Berman,California to Teach Media Literacy in Every Grade,2023-10-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assembly Bill 873, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom last night, highlighting the urgency of young people’s growing reliance on the internet and social media to consume news and information. AB 873 will integrate media literacy instruction into the four core subjects that all students learn from kindergarten through 12th grade in California. AB 873 will bring California in line with a small but growing number of states teaching media literacy in grade school.
“Teaching media literacy is a key strategy to support our children, their families, and our society that are inundated with misinformation and disinformation on social media networks and digital platforms,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “As we've seen too often in the last decade, what happens online can have the most terrifying of real-world impacts. From climate denial to vaccine conspiracy theories to the January 6 attack on our nation’s Capital, the spread of online misinformation has had global and deadly consequences. We have a responsibility to teach the next generation to be more critical consumers of online content and more guarded against misinformation, propaganda, and conspiracy theories. In addition, this instruction will help students to be more responsible digital citizens, more intentional about what they put online, and better understand online safety and privacy. Thank you to Governor Newsom for signing AB 873 and affirming that media literacy instruction is essential to keeping our students safer online and to safeguarding the future of our democracy.”
""GENup is proud to announce Assembly Bill 873 has been signed into law by Governor Newsom. GENup, as a cosponsor of the bill, views the inclusion of media literacy content in K-12 curriculum as important for preparing California's students to have the informational literacy skills needed to engage critically with online content. We want to again thank our community partners for their support, and look forward to continuing to advocate for California's students alongside them."" said Nicholas Harvey, K-12 Policy Director for Generation Up.
 
AB 873 directs the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to incorporate media literacy content into the English language arts/English language development, science, mathematics, and history-social science curriculum frameworks when those frameworks are next revised. Media literacy, also known as information literacy, develops students’ critical thinking skills around all types of media and teaches students to evaluate online information that affects them, their communities, and the world. It includes digital citizenship, which is a diverse set of skills related to current technology and social media, including the norms of appropriate, responsible, and healthy behavior. Additionally, it includes teaching students how to create media thoughtfully and conscientiously. A growing number of states are now requiring that students receive instruction in media and information literacy, including New Jersey, Illinois, and Delaware.
A 2019 Stanford University study gauged students’ ability to evaluate digital sources on the open internet. 96 percent of high school students surveyed failed to consider that ties to the fossil fuel industry might affect the credibility of a website about climate change, while more than half believed a grainy video that claimed to show ballot stuffing (which was actually shot in Russia) constituted “strong evidence” of voter fraud in the United States. Another study found that 82 percent of middle school students struggled to distinguish advertisements from news stories. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, 17% of public TikTok content related to the Holocaust either denied or distorted it. The same was true of almost 1 in 5 Holocaust-related Twitter posts and 49% of Holocaust content on Telegram. The report highlighted how much more remains to be done to strengthen global resilience to disinformation.
AB 873 is supported by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, Common Sense Media, the California News Publishers Association, and Media Literacy Now, among others.

Marc Berman,Berman Champions Elections Bills Signed by Governor,2023-10-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bills 1037, 1219, and 1539, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), to advance election accessibility and security. The bills signed today build on Assemblymember Berman’s continued efforts to strengthen and defend California’s democracy.
 “Over the past seven years, while politicians have sought to undermine our democracy and disenfranchise voters in states across the country, California has been unwavering in our commitment to expand ballot access and strengthen our democracy,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “We’ve taken steps to send a vote by mail ballot to every active registered voter, create a system to track your ballot and increase transparency, make registration simpler, make ballot language more accessible, strengthen our elections cybersecurity, and increase access to ballot drop boxes. I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing this new package of elections bills to continue this critically important work to advance election security and accessibility.”
“Our democracy is strongest when everyone participates,” continued Assemblymember Berman. “Governor Newsom has been an important ally in my years-long work to strengthen elections in California.”
 
Ballot Design
AB 1219 updates and improves the ballot design for voters while providing county elections officials with additional flexibility to reflect the diversity of counties and election systems.
 “The design of a ballot plays a critical role in ensuring that every voter properly understands how to participate in their democracy and have their voice heard,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “According to the Center for Civic Design, a ballot is a form that represents perhaps the most important interaction between a government and its citizens. Poor ballot design affects all voters and can result in the disenfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of votes. In 2019, based on feedback from a constituent, I authored the bill that created the Ballot Design Advisory Committee. It is tremendously heartening to see the results of that effort signed into law today.”
""Ballots must be user friendly,"" said California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, Ph.D. ""The easier we make ballots to read and understand, the more likely voters will be to participate in elections. AB 1219 will codify the recommendations of the Ballot Design Advisory Committee so that elections officials will develop ballots that are easier to read, that use plain language, and that make it clearer what and who people are voting for. The design advancements in this bill will go a long way towards making it easier for voters to participate in our democracy.”
In 2019, Assemblymember Berman authored AB 623, which directed the Secretary of State to establish a Ballot Design Advisory Committee to bring experts and stakeholders together to facilitate a comprehensive discussion and thorough examination of ballots, their design and their instructions, to better ensure that a voter’s choices are counted. The Ballot Design Advisory Committee engaged the Center for Civic Design and included representatives from 18 county elections offices. It held eight public meetings in 2021 and 2022, culminating in the issuance of an August 2022 report making numerous recommendations for changes to the Elections Code.
AB 1219 would implement the recommendations of the Ballot Design Advisory Committee. This would enhance voters’ experience by simplifying instructions and providing elections officials more flexibility when designing ballot layouts that are user friendly. Key changes would provide ballot instructions in plain language so that voters may easily understand the nature of every election and how to mark a ballot, update font size requirements to provide flexibility for jurisdictions providing multilingual ballots, ensure that an administrative error or design will not inadvertently invalidate ballots, and codify ballot instructions for recall elections.
 
Ballot Cure
AB 1037 authorizes county elections officials to offer the option for California voters to fix or cure their Vote by Mail (VBM) ballot electronically if the elections official determines that the signature does not match, or if the ballot envelope lacks a signature.
“Far too many ballots go uncounted due to uncorrected mismatched or missing signatures,” said Assemblymember Berman. “‘Text to cure’ has been successfully utilized in Nevada and Colorado, allowing those voters the option to cure their ballot signature issues easier and faster. AB 1037 will give California’s voters more flexibility and provide greater efficiency.”
“As we expand the use of vote by mail, it is critical to ensure the process is equitable, fair and increases engagement,” said Stephanie Doute, Executive Director of the League of Women Voters of California. “AB 1037 is an important step to modernize the system and help guarantee that all eligible votes are counted, and every voter is heard.”
“We are pleased with the passage and enactment of AB 1037 as it expands the ability for election administrators to assist voters in curing inadvertent issues that impact the processing of their ballots, “ said Dean Logan, Los Angeles County Registrar—Recorder/County Clerk. “This legislation helps reinforce the principle that every vote counts.”
Data from multiple statewide elections shows a pattern across the state that voters are not curing their ballots upon receiving notification at a significant rate. Additionally, some voters who return a signature verification statement still have their ballot challenged due to differences between the electronic signature provided to the Department of Motor Vehicles and the handwritten signatures on their VBM identification envelope. Accordingly, AB 1037 would additionally permit voters to submit a signature verification statement or unsigned identification envelope statement by other electronic means made available by the local elections official. In doing so, AB 1037 will help ensure that voters are allowed every opportunity to verify their signature.
 
Double Voting
AB 1539 prohibits a person from voting in both California and another state in elections that occur on the same day.
“Voting twice in the same election in two different states is a violation of the principle of one-person, one-vote,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 1539 ensures that California does not have to rely on another states’ laws to address the issue of multi-state double voting.”
“One person one vote. It’s our Democracy and we have to take care of it,” said Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen.
Sponsored by the Santa Clara County District Attorney, AB 1539 prohibits multi-state double voting by providing that a person who votes or attempts to vote both in an election held in California and in another state on the same date shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. While voter fraud is extremely rare, his happened with three residents of Santa Clara County, and the District Attorney’s Office was forced to defer prosecution to the other state, which has a law that unambiguously outlaws multi-state voting. The bill would also recognize an exception for unique elections such as a landowner voter district or any other district where an elector is not required to be a resident.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Historic Financial Aid Reform Bill,2023-10-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Yesterday Governor Newsom signed AB 789, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which makes groundbreaking, student-centered reforms to financial aid in California. The bill enables students to continue their education by removing barriers to keeping their financial aid and creating uniformity and transparency for students to appeal adverse decisions.
“Too many California students are losing their financial aid and are having their higher education dreams dashed due to inflated and confusing restrictions,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “These unnecessarily onerous rules result in significant numbers of marginalized students facing financial aid disqualification. AB 789 will provide all higher education students in California with the financial aid flexibility, certainty, and clarity they deserve, keeping students in school so that they can accomplish their higher education and career goals. Thank you to Governor Newsom for your commitment to supporting students.”
AB 789 will ensure that postsecondary institutions across California do not impose Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements stricter than those required by federal law. It will also ensure that institutions consider a broader range of extenuating circumstances as a basis for an appeal to reinstate financial aid. Lastly, the bill creates a pathway for students who have disenrolled while on SAP disqualification to regain aid upon re-enrollment.
""As the lead sponsor of AB 789, John Burton Advocates for Youth is delighted that the Legislature recognizes the critical impact this bill will have on college students across California. For far too long, overly stringent SAP policies have disadvantaged already marginalized students, resulting in significant numbers losing their financial aid and discontinuing their higher education. AB 789 will ensure that students, particularly those from low-income and minority populations, can keep their financial aid, stay enrolled, and achieve their higher education goals,"" said Sarah Pauter, John Burton Advocates for Youth.
""Another step has been taken to ensure the transparency and accessibility of our higher education system. AB 789 will ensure that students are alleviated of undue burdens and restrictions that cause them to lose access to their financial aid, and thus their higher education. We must make it a priority to continue advocating for financial aid accessibility in order to provide students with the tools needed to achieve academic success,"" said UC Student Association President Celene Aridin.
“In the face of an unprecedented enrollment crisis affecting all California public higher education institutions and looming tuition hikes, ensuring access to financial aid is essential for students’ success. AB 789 will not only help to keep current students enrolled, but it will also allow those who have had to disenroll due to prior SAP disqualification the ability to apply to regain access to critical financial aid upon reentry,” said Dominic Quan Treseler, Cal State Student Association President.
“As inflation and the total cost of attendance continue to increase, we must fight for equitable higher education, greater transparency, and better student support. AB 789 will help ensure existing students remain enrolled while providing reassurance to aspiring students,” said Chanelle Win, Student Senate of California Community Colleges VPLA.
“Access to financial aid is critical for students to get to and through their postsecondary experience, and today California took a positive step forward to ensure that those who rely the most on financial aid aren't at risk of losing it due to arbitrary rules. California students deserve satisfactory academic progress policies that are aligned with, not stricter than, federal requirements and an appeal process that acknowledges their lived experiences, so they have every chance to achieve their postsecondary dreams,” said Manny Rodriguez, The Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS).
In order to maintain a Cal Grant or federal financial aid, students must meet certain federally governed SAP standards, such as a minimum Grade Point Average, a maximum timeframe for completion, and a minimum course completion rate. A report released in July 2021, titled “The Overlooked Obstacle – How Satisfactory Academic Progress Policies Impede Student Success and Equity,” found that 24 percent of first-year California community college students receiving a federal Pell Grant did not meet SAP standards during their first two consecutive academic terms. Black and Native American students were twice as likely as white and Asian students to not meet those standards. Likewise, students not meeting SAP standards was also found to be a significant issue at four-year universities. Students who are deemed as not meeting their institution’s SAP standards during any two consecutive academic terms or one year of enrollment must have their Cal Grant and federal financial aid terminated unless they successfully appeal that determination.
Federal regulations allow students to appeal the loss of financial aid due to special circumstances as defined by each individual postsecondary educational institution. Some postsecondary educational institutions do not take full advantage of federal flexibility related to grounds for appeal, unnecessarily limiting students’ ability to keep their financial aid. As evidence of the gravity of the problem, “The Overlooked Obstacle” report revealed that 87 percent of the California community college students who did not make SAP standards during their first two consecutive academic terms either disenrolled or lost their financial aid.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Berman Bills to Strengthen California's Gun Safety Laws,2023-09-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bills 1420 and 1598, both authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), to protect Californians from gun violence. AB 1420 gives the California Department of Justice (DOJ) the authority and enforcement tools necessary to hold lawbreaking firearm dealers accountable and ensure they are complying with California’s smart gun safety laws. AB 1598 ensures that potential firearm purchasers are made aware of the risks of owning and bringing a firearm into the home, as well as learn about California’s life-saving firearm laws.
“California has some of the smartest, strongest gun safety laws in the country, but we must do more to reduce the scourge of gun violence in our communities,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “This past January a horrific shooting in Half Moon Bay rocked my district. In the aftermath, the message from my constituents was clear: do more to combat gun violence. We have endured our collective grief and frustration long enough. As a founding member of the Gun Violence Working Group in the Legislature, I introduced AB 1420 and AB 1598, two smart, pragmatic bills that received bipartisan support from my colleagues. I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing these bills so that Californians can take another step towards a future where we no longer live under the constant threat of gun violence.”
Cracking Down on Lawbreaking Gun Shops
AB 1420 will ensure the California DOJ has the authority and tools necessary to adequately enforce any violations relating to the governing of the sale, transfer, and storage of firearms.
“Smart gun safety laws work. California has some of the toughest gun safety laws in the nation, and one of the lowest firearm death rates. But bad actor gun shops are skirting these life-saving laws,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “AB 1420 will crack down on gun shops that are not following California's firearm laws. I am proud to partner with Attorney General Rob Bonta to ensure that the Department of Justice has the necessary authority to enforce California's life-saving firearm laws. We cannot tolerate gun shops flagrantly violating our laws with no recourse.”
“My office is proud to sponsor Assembly Bill 1420 to expand the California Department of Justice’s ability to conduct firearm dealer inspections and ensure dealers are following California’s gun laws,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. “California has some of the strongest gun safety laws in the nation — and these laws save lives. AB 1420 provides California DOJ with the necessary authority and tools to hold accountable gun dealers who transfer, sell, or store firearms in violation of these laws. I thank Assemblymember Marc Berman and our state leaders for advancing AB 1420 to help ensure that law enforcement has the tools we need to enforce California’s commonsense gun laws and keep our communities safe.”
 
Busting the Myths of Gun Ownership
AB 1598 expands what is covered on the firearm safety certificate (FSC) test, requires that FSC applicants receive a study guide with this safety information prior to the test, and requires that information about the risks of gun ownership be provided at point of sale.
“Many people buy firearms because they think it will make them safer at home. The evidence is indisputable, however: keeping a firearm in your home dramatically increases the likelihood that you or someone you love will be a victim of gun violence,” said Assemblymember Berman. “The data clearly shows that having a firearm at home increases the risk of death or serious injury by suicide, homicide, or unintentional injury. The myth that having a gun at home will keep you safe disproportionately harms women, who are uniquely impacted by the presence of a firearm in the home. In fact, the National Domestic Violence Hotline reports that the presence of a gun in the home increases the risk of homicide for women by 500 percent. AB 1598 will ensure that Californians are fully informed of the risks of gun ownership before they buy a gun.”
“This will give firearm owners accurate information about the risks posed by having a firearm in the home, and about protective orders for high-risk situations when someone is at risk of harm. With this, they can make more informed, independent, and responsible decisions about their firearms and the safety of their families,” said Amy Barnhorst, MD, psychiatrist and Associate Director of the California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC Davis.
""Family physicians have long recognized that gun violence is a national public health epidemic,"" said California Academy of Family Physicians (CAFP) President Raul Ayala, MD, MHCM. ""We care for victims of gun violence every day. Gun violence is a physical and psychological trauma that affects the health of our patients, families, and communities. AB 1598 is part of a needed comprehensive public health approach to address the gun violence epidemic by requiring education and demonstrated knowledge about the responsibilities of gun ownership and operation. Thank you Assemblymember Berman for helping family physicians care for and protect our patients and communities from the devastating effects of gun violence.""
“When Californians go to purchase a firearm, they should be empowered with the facts—including how to use them safely and the risks of having a firearm in their home,” said Zeenat Yahya, the Director of Policy at March For Our Lives and a native Californian. “This bill will give Californians the tools they need to make an informed decision and help protect the lives of families and children across the state. We already lead the country on gun safety, and this bill is another chance for us to keep leading. AB 1598 will encourage responsible, safe gun ownership and we’re pleased to support this measure.”

Marc Berman,Legislature Passes Bill to Crack Down on Hotel Junk Fees,2023-09-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Legislature passed Assemblymember Marc Berman’s (D-Menlo Park) AB 537 with strong bipartisan support. If signed by the Governor, the bill will crack down on hidden fees – what President Biden termed “junk fees” – by requiring that mandatory hotel and resort fees be disclosed in the advertised, offered, and displayed room rates.
“Californians are fed up with surprise hotel charges like cleaning or resort fees that are both dishonest and misleading,” said Assemblymember Berman. “We’ve all had the experience of going to a lodging website, entering the dates of your stay, picking a room for a certain price, entering your personal information, and then at the very last step the hotel or travel website tacks on resort or cleaning fees. Earlier this year I was charged a destination fee at a hotel. It's a hotel. Being a destination isn’t a special add-on, it’s quite literally the essence of a hotel. Enough is enough. AB 537 will ensure that the advertised cost of your hotel stay is the real price you pay.”
“Reports show that U.S. hotels generate billions of dollars from mandatory hotel fees,” Berman added. “President Biden has made it clear: hidden fees, charges, and add-ons designed either to confuse or deceive consumers are unacceptable. Thank you to all our supporters and to Senator Glazer for your partnership on this important consumer protection legislation.”
“Internet lodging reservations should be honest and straightforward rather than a bait and switch trap door of price manipulation,” said Senator Steve Glazer, D-Contra Costa. “This legislation will ensure fair dealings for the traveling public.”
Senator Glazer authored a similar bill, SB 683, which would have required all lodging services, including hotels, short-term rentals, and third party booking services, to display the total cost of the stay including all extra fees, rather than just the “nightly” cost.
""The Consumer Federation of California is proud to sponsor AB 537 and thank Assemblymember Berman for taking the lead on this basic pocketbook issue,"" said Robert Herrell, Executive Director of the Consumer Federation of California. ""Resort fees are becoming more common, more expensive, and more troublesome by the day. Many companies manipulate consumers and their internet searches into thinking they're getting a better deal than they really are. That's why states and jurisdictions like Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. have taken bipartisan legal actions against these often-times hidden fees. Consumers should know what they're getting and the complete price from the moment they start looking. That's just common sense and basic consumer protection.""
Over the last few years, deceptive advertising in the short-term lodging industry has significantly increased, with many hotels, motels, and other short-term lodging establishments not disclosing mandatory fees in advance. Some hotels charge separate mandatory “resort fees” or “cleaning fees”, but fail to disclose them until later in the booking process (once most consumers have committed to the property) or at “checkout”. According to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times, at least one thousand of the 40,000 Airbnb listings included in the study charged a cleaning fee that was only $10 less than the nightly rate. The study also found that 83% of short-term rentals in Los Angeles charged a cleaning fee which typically ranged from $5 to $1,500, with one fee as much as $2,500. Furthermore, this report showed that in 2018, across the U.S., hotels generated approximately $3 billion in mandatory hotel fees, an 8.5% increase compared to 2017.

We thank Assemblymember Berman for his leadership on this effort, as well as the Legislature's critical leadership in passing a groundbreaking bill that will provide an ongoing funding stream for extremely important programs such as this one (AB 28),"" said Sean Holian, State Legislative Director, Giffords.
In 2013, California established the FSC Program to ensure that everyone who buys a firearm is a responsible gun-owner with demonstrated knowledge of safe handling and gun laws. AB 1598 would expand what the FSC test covers by including explicitly the reasons for and risks of owning a firearm and bringing a firearm into the home, including the increased risk of death to someone in the household by suicide, homicide, or unintentional injury. Additionally, this bill would require the test to also cover California’s current laws relating to eligibility to own or possess a firearm, gun violence restraining orders, domestic violence restraining orders, and laws related to privately manufactured firearms. This bill also ensures that FSC applicants are receiving a study guide created by the Department of Justice that provides all the information covered in the test.
Lastly, this bill would require the Department of Justice to create a pamphlet that provides the reasons for and risks of owning and bringing a firearm into the home. This pamphlet would then be provided to firearm purchasers at point of sale at the start of the ten day waiting period. 
 
Assemblymember Berman is also authoring AB 1420 this year which would ensure that the Department of Justice has the authority to inspect and write citations for any violations related to the governing of the sale, transfer, and storage of firearms.

Marc Berman,Berman Bill to Teach Media Literacy in Every Grade Passes Legislature,2023-09-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Senate passed AB 873 with bipartisan support, highlighting the urgency of young people’s growing reliance on the internet and social media to consume news. If signed, AB 873 would integrate media literacy instruction into the core subjects that all students learn from kindergarten through 12th grade in California.
“Children today are inundated by misinformation and disinformation on social media networks and digital platforms,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “As we've seen too often in the last decade, what happens online often has the most terrifying of real-world impacts. From climate denial to vaccine conspiracy theories to the January 6 attack on our nation’s Capitol, the spread of online misinformation has had global and deadly consequences. We have a responsibility to teach the next generation to be more critical consumers of online content and more guarded against misinformation, propaganda, and conspiracy theories. In addition, this instruction will help students to be more responsible digital citizens, more intentional about what they put online, and better understand online safety and privacy. Media literacy instruction is essential to keeping our students safer online and to safeguarding the future of our democracy.”
“GENup is proud of Assembly Bill 873's passage through the Senate. GENup, as a cosponsor of the legislation, views the incorporation of media literacy content into K-12 curriculum as important for preparing California's students to have the informational literacy skills needed to engage critically with online content. We want to thank all of our community partners for their support, and look forward to securing the Governor's signature on this bill."" said Nicholas Harvey, K-12 Policy Director for Generation Up.
AB 873 directs the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to incorporate media literacy content into the English language arts/English language development, science, mathematics, and history-social science curriculum frameworks when those frameworks are next revised. Media literacy, also known as information literacy, develops students’ critical thinking skills around all types of media and teaches students to evaluate online information that affects them, their communities, and the world. It includes digital citizenship, which is a diverse set of skills related to current technology and social media, including the norms of appropriate, responsible, and healthy behavior. Additionally, it includes teaching students how to create media thoughtfully and conscientiously. A growing number of states are now requiring that students receive instruction in media and information literacy, including New Jersey, Illinois, and Delaware.
A 2019 Stanford University study gauged students’ ability to evaluate digital sources on the open internet. 96 percent of high school students surveyed failed to consider that ties to the fossil fuel industry might affect the credibility of a website about climate change, while more than half believed a grainy video that claimed to show ballot stuffing (which was actually shot in Russia) constituted “strong evidence” of voter fraud in the United States. Another study found that 82 percent of middle school students struggled to distinguish advertisements from news stories. According to a 2022 report by the United Nations, 17% of public TikTok content related to the Holocaust either denied or distorted it. The same was true of almost 1 in 5 Holocaust-related Twitter posts and 49% of Holocaust content on Telegram. The report highlighted how much more remains to be done to strengthen global resilience to disinformation.
AB 873 is supported by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, Common Sense Media, the California News Publishers Association, and Media Literacy Now, among others. The bill now head to the Governor.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman's Bill to Guarantee Access to Computer Science Passes Key Committee,2023-07-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today the Senate Education Committee unanimously passed Assemblymember Marc Berman’s (D-Menlo Park) bill AB 1054, which will ensure that all public high school students in California have access to computer science education. AB 1054 will help to align California with 27 other states that already require that public high schools offer computer science education.
“Too many California students grow up in the shadows of California’s famous tech companies, yet go to schools that don’t even offer them the opportunity to learn the skills they need to one day work there,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “After years of frustratingly slow progress on increasing access to computer science education, we are finally making significant strides toward universal access for California’s students. The passage of AB 1054 from the Senate Education committee is a win for students across our state and a win for employers looking to fill jobs with homegrown talent. Not only does this address a gaping equity issue in our schools and in the tech sector, it will also significantly strengthen California's economy.""
 
Here's what leading computer science education advocates have to say:
 
“Offering the opportunity to learn computer science is absolutely critical for preparing our students for the career needs of the 21st century — not just for coding or computing occupations, but for every career. This bill is take it a step further to ensuring all high schools offer at least one course in foundational computer science means that all students - regardless of their background, identity, or location,"" Codeye J. Woody, Director of State Government Affairs for Code.org.
""Every student deserves to be equipped with the knowledge, tools, and resources to successfully participate and thrive in modern society. As technology continues to expand, today’s students need access to culturally relevant and engaging high quality computer science education. Unfortunately, too many students, particularly Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income students, don’t have access to these foundational learning opportunities. CSforCA firmly believes that offering computer science courses at all California's high schools is the next step in achieving educational equity across the state and build a better future for everyone,"" said Julie Flapan, CSforCA Co-Director.
“California is a leader in innovation but lags behind in ensuring equity and access to computer science education. Requiring all high schools to offer at least one computer science course is a critical next step in preparing the next generation of Californians for rewarding career pathways and informed community engagement,” said Lia Nitake, Deputy Executive Director for TechNet.
“Compter science and computational thinking allow students to develop multiple skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving that can engage and drive our young adults to be the next generation of innovators. California needs to re-double its efforts to ensure all students have access to high-quality teaching and learning across all STEM subjects, including computer science. We look forward to working with Assembly member Berman to secure the additional commitments and support from the state to do just that,” said Adonai Mack, Senior Director of Education for Children Now.
""SVLG believes that every student, regardless of zip code or background, deserves a high-quality education that teaches problem solving and critical thinking—foundational skills taught in every computer science course, and necessary to compete in the modern hiring environment. From a business perspective, investing in equitable computer science education at the K-12 level will lead to a more diverse, and more productive workforce of the future,"" Ahmad Thomas, CEO of Silicon Valley Leadership Group.
“Technology plays a major role in our everyday lives, from the moment we wake up, to bedtime and everything in between. The latest innovations are taking root right here in California. CTA is pleased to support AB 1054, which will allow students, especially those from our communities who would otherwise not have access to acquire computer science skills, the option to take courses that will help prepare them for the 21st century job market,” said CTA President David Goldberg. “We thank Assemblymember Berman for his leadership and focus on equity so that all students can have access to computer science education.”
“College Board recognizes the importance of diversity in computer science and supports legislative efforts by Assemblymember Berman to ensure that all students across California, including Black, Hispanic, Native-American, and rural students, have access to at least one foundational and high-quality computer science course in high school,” said Tara Thomas, College Board’s Vice President of State & District Partnerships, Western Region. “This step is imperative to preparing these students for high-paying, fast-paced jobs and to drive innovation, creativity, and competitiveness.”
""California will only remain a leader in innovation if we continue to invest in our greatest asset; our homegrown talent. That's why Snap Inc. is proud to support AB 1054, to make access to quality computer science education available in all of California's high schools. It's critical that we prepare the next generation of leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs across our state, and we thank Assemblymember Berman and the state legislature for their leadership on this issue,"" said Snap Inc. Public Policy Manager Jasson Crockett. 
“Digital skills have become foundational for full participation both in the marketplace and in civic life,” said former CA State Controller and 21st Century Chair Steve Westly. “Access to computer science education cannot be reserved for the few. We applaud Assemblymember Berman’s leadership in this effort to help offer all California students the educational opportunities they deserve.”
It is critically important to ensure all students in California have equitable access to computer science education. 75.1% of high school students in California attend a school that offers computer science, but despite years of work, significant disparities in access persist. Rural schools, urban schools, and schools with high percentages of economically disadvantaged students continue to be less likely to offer computer science. Black students, Latinx students, and Native American/Alaskan students are less likely to attend a school that offers computer science[1]. Computer science engages students in school, supports learning in other subject areas, and provides pathways for future opportunities for students.
The time is now to pass AB 1054. Passing this critical piece of legislation will demonstrate the state’s commitment to equitable, high-quality computer science education and equip all California students for success.

Marc Berman,Berman Champions State Funding for Farmworker Housing on the Coastside,2023-07-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) secured $2.5 million in the 2023-24 state budget for two affordable farmworker housing projects on the San Mateo County Coast. The funding includes $1.25 million for the City of Half Moon Bay and $1.25 million for San Mateo County for separate farmworker housing projects.
“After the horrendous mass shooting earlier this year highlighted the inhumane living conditions farmworkers are subject to on the Coastside, securing funding for farmworker housing became my top budget priority,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Farmworkers are an essential part of my district, and their wellbeing is fundamental to the prosperity of San Mateo County and all of California. Renting a two-bedroom apartment in Half Moon Bay costs approximately 97% of the median income for a County farmworker, making it practically impossible. This funding will help build two desperately needed farmworker housing projects on the San Mateo County coast and will start to move the needle for the most vulnerable among us.”
“We are so grateful to have advocates at the state like Assemblymember Berman pushing for essential funding streams,” said San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller. “Bringing more dignified housing to farmworkers on the coast is a principal need that I am proud we are all working towards quickly. Assemblymember Berman fought hard for this funding in a tough economic year, and it’s going to make a significant impact.”
 “We are so grateful to Assemblymember Berman for championing our need for additional funding to house farmworkers on the Coastside. We appreciate his continual support of Half Moon Bay projects,” said Half Moon Bay Mayor Deborah Penrose. “By securing $1.25M in this year’s State budget, we will be able to advance planned projects to house displaced farmworkers following the January mass shooting event. Half Moon Bay thrives on agriculture and our farmworkers are a vital component of an industry we are proud to have here on the Coastside. Ensuring they have safe, adequate, comfortable living conditions is a priority area of ours, and this funding will bring us one step closer in providing that.”
San Mateo County farmworkers and their families are among the most economically vulnerable residents in the county due to the high cost of housing and the very limited supply of affordable units. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the City and surrounding Coastside communities is $3,000 a month. The Census block information for the project area indicates that the median farmworker household income is $37,150, which is less than 20% of the County area median income for a family of four. This economic reality has forced choices of desperation, including extreme overcrowding and the use of substandard dwelling spaces. Accordingly, the State, County, and City of Half Moon Bay are committed to providing more safe, affordable and healthy housing for farmworkers.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Secures State Funding to Retrofit Los Altos’ Emergency Operations Center,2023-07-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) secured $500,000 in the 2023-24 state budget for the City of Los Altos to retrofit the City’s Community Center to house the Emergency Operations Center.
“The last few years have shown that the best time to invest in emergency preparedness is now,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Despite a budgetary downturn, I am thrilled to have secured $500,000 in the state budget to retrofit the City of Los Altos’ Emergency Operations Center. This project is a great example of good governance as it is both fiscally prudent and forward thinking. The unfortunate reality is that our communities are at constant risk, whether that be from floods or fires or earthquakes. The retrofitted Emergency Operations Center will keep Los Altans safer when the next emergency strikes.”
“This grant will go a long way,” said Los Altos Mayor Sally Meadows. “The recent storms underscored the need for a more robust emergency response network in Los Altos. The project is already underway and the additional resources this grant provides will significantly advance the project timeline. Ultimately, our emergency response personnel will be better equipped to respond to the needs of the community during emergency situations.”
The January storms highlighted the need to improve the City of Los Altos’ emergency response network. The City’s community center meets all of the requirements as an essential services building, but needs to be retrofitted to house the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Retrofitting an existing building was identified as a less expensive but equally effective option for the EOC. The retrofit will include electrical upgrades and repairs, the acquisition of communications equipment and a generator, as well as resiliency equipment and operating items necessary for a functioning EOC. The project is approved and is moving forward with the design planning.

Marc Berman,Berman Champions State Funding to Improve Accessibility of Campbell City Hall,2023-07-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) secured $500,000 in the 2023-24 state budget for the City of Campbell to renovate City Hall to improve accessibility and meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards.
“An accessible government is key to building public trust and ensuring all residents’ voices are heard,” said Assemblymember Berman. “In the face of a shrinking state budget, I am thrilled to have secured $500,000 in the state budget to renovate Campbell City Hall to ensure that it is fully accessible to all residents. These facility improvements will greatly benefit community members who depend on their local government to obtain critical services.”
“I was pleased to hear from Assemblymember Berman that $500k was approved for this project through the State budget process. The City Hall ADA facility improvement project aligns with the City’s Strategic Goals and Objectives and will include upgrades to city hall public counters and accessibility improvements to better serve Campbell residents. I am proud of the collaboration between the City and our State elected leaders,” said Campbell Mayor Anne Bybee.
This state appropriation will fund renovations to public counters and public meeting spaces, as well as accessibility improvements to the main entrances and public service counters spaces. These areas pose significant accessibility challenges and are in need of upgrades. The main entrance consists of long sloping ramps that would be improved to meet current standards. The service areas include Community Development, Planning and Building, Public Works, Engineering, and Finance and Administration. All of these areas have significant daily use and improvements would greatly benefit residents who use these spaces to obtain city services. The Council Chambers also have accessibility issues with the existing fixed seating and access to the Council Dias area. This project would remove the fixed seating and provide for better access to the Dias and related spaces.

Marc Berman,Becker and Berman Jointly Name ALAS Nonprofit of the Year,2023-06-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) honored Ayudando Latinos A Soñar (ALAS), a social service nonprofit and farmworker advocacy organization based in Half Moon Bay as their 2023 California Nonprofit of the Year.
As part of the Legislature’s commemoration of California Nonprofits Day, ALAS joined 114 other organizations that legislators have selected statewide to honor at a luncheon at the State Capitol.
“I am so pleased to jointly choose ALAS as Nonprofit of the Year along with Assemblymember Berman. ALAS has been at the forefront supporting farmworkers and families—not only highlighting concerns like living conditions, mental wellness, economic prosperity, and broadband access, but also providing solutions,” said Senator Becker. “Under the direction of Dr. Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga, the staff and board of ALAS have created a vibrant communal space and have collaborated with various partners to enable them to expand their services to farms and ranches via the mobile resource center, the Farmworker Equity Express. ALAS embodies the best of California—vision, compassion, activism, hard work, humility and most of all a passion for social justice.”
“ALAS has long been a leader on the Coastside, collaborating with organizations and public agencies to bring services to farmworkers and their families who sacrifice so much so we have food on the table, but who far too often fall through the cracks of societies safety net,” said Assemblymember Berman. “When the farmworker community in Half Moon Bay was devastated by a mass shooting in January, ALAS stepped up to serve and care for the grieving community. ALAS honors our farmworkers who are an integral part of the San Mateo Coastside community, and whose wellbeing is fundamental to the prosperity of San Mateo County. I'm so grateful to the entire ALAS team for your dedicated and compassionate service to our farmworkers.”
Each year, the California Association of Nonprofits gives state legislators an opportunity to bring attention and recognition to outstanding nonprofits and collectively illustrate the remarkable diversity and vibrancy of the California nonprofit community. The honorees serve communities in the state’s metropolitan regions, suburban neighborhoods and rural communities. Like ALAS, these organizations address a wide range of issues—from homelessness and health to workers’ rights, to education, the arts and the environment.
For years, ALAS has been serving the North San Mateo County Coast farmworker community with a focus on cross-cultural collaboration and building special relationships among farmworker families. Senator Becker and Assemblymember Berman will also honor ALAS with a local celebration in the district later this year.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman’s Bill to Expand Media Literacy Instruction to all K-12 Students Passes Assembly,2023-05-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Assembly unanimously passed AB 873, which would integrate media literacy instruction into the core subjects for all students from kindergarten through 12th grade. In light of young people’s growing reliance on the internet and social media to consume news, AB 873 will prepare all K-12 students in California to be competent and critical media consumers and creators.
“Children today are being inundated by misinformation and disinformation on social media networks and digital platforms,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “The last few years have been a terrifying wake-up call to the insidious nature of online misinformation, from jeopardizing public health, to threatening the foundation of our democracy, to dangerously rewriting history. Anyone who spends much time on social media could greatly benefit from media literacy training. While I can’t force adults to go back to school, we have the chance right now to teach the next generation to ask themselves: who wrote this, why did they write it, and what is the impact of sharing it? Media literacy instruction is absolutely essential to keeping our students safer online and to safeguarding the future of our democracy.”
“This bill is an important step to help ensure young people are equipped with the relevant media and informational literacy skills so critical in the 21st century. As a proud youth-cosponsor of this legislation, GENup welcomes the bill’s passage through the Assembly and looks forward to continuing to advocate for the bill’s passage in the Senate and onto the Governor’s desk,” said Nicholas Harvey, K-12 Policy Director for Generation Up.
 
AB 873 directs the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to incorporate media literacy content into the English language arts/English language development, science, mathematics, and history-social science curriculum frameworks when those frameworks are next revised.

It also includes teaching students how to create media thoughtfully and conscientiously. A growing number of states are now requiring that students receive instruction in media and information literacy, including New Jersey, Illinois, and Delaware.
A 2022 Pew Research Report found that the share of teens who say they use the internet about once a day or more has grown since 2014-15. Today, 97% of teens say they use the internet daily, compared with 92% of teens in 2014-15 who said the same. Social media use has also grown for younger kids. Another report found that about half of parents of children ages 10 to 12 and 32% of parents of kids ages 7 to 9 reported their child used social media apps in 2021. 
A 2019 Stanford University study gauged students’ ability to evaluate digital sources on the open internet. 96 percent of high school students surveyed failed to consider that ties to the fossil fuel industry might affect the credibility of a website about climate change, while more than half believed a grainy video that claimed to show ballot stuffing (which was actually shot in Russia) constituted “strong evidence” of voter fraud in the United States.

Marc Berman,Legislature Approves Audit of VTA,2023-03-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today the Joint Legislative Audit Committee approved Assemblymember Marc Berman’s (D-Menlo Park) request to audit the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), with a focus on the areas of governance structure, project planning and management, financial viability, and fiscal oversight.
“My hope is that this audit will give VTA the objective and professional feedback and direction it needs to undertake substantive governance reform so that the board can provide the high-quality oversight of the agency that riders, VTA staff, and Santa Clara County taxpayers deserve,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “I would like to thank the Joint Legislative Audit Committee for their unanimous, bipartisan support for this audit. Should the audit identify structural deficiencies and recommend reforms, I look forward to working with VTA to have the difficult but important conversations necessary so that VTA itself can propose state legislation to address the audit’s recommendations.”
“Over the last 20 years, three Civil Grand Jury Reports, multiple consultants hired by VTA, and a 2008 audit by the State Auditor have identified the need for change to VTA’s governance structure in order for the Board to be best equipped to provide high-quality oversight of the agency. The State Auditor is uniquely equipped to look beyond individual interests and provide a cohesive, apolitical set of recommendations for VTA to use to have the important conversation of governance reform. I want to thank all of the board members both past and present, transit riders, and advocates who met with me over the last two years who recognize the need for governance reform in order to better serve the county’s residents. In particular I would like to thank immediate past VTA Board Chair and former San Jose Vice Mayor Chappie Jones for his partnership in our shared endeavor to create a stable, experienced, and regionally focused board of directors,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman.
The approved audit conducted by the California State Auditor will provide independently developed and verified information related to the VTA’s governance structure, project planning and management, financial viability, and fiscal oversight. The audit’s scope includes, among other things, an evaluation of whether the VTA board member selection and tenure practices are effective and whether they align with state law and best practices, and whether VTA could increase transparency related to the selection of its board members. The audit will also consider whether state law governing the board’s structure needs to be changed.
The audit will assess whether VTA’s board and management appropriately carry out their governance-related roles and responsibilities, including their oversight of agency funds. The auditor will compare VTA’s results in multiple performance metrics, including operating costs per trip and number of passenger trips per revenue hour, to those of other similarly situated local transit agencies. The auditor’s assessment of VTA’s project planning and oversight will include an analysis of the extent to which VTA provided adequate planning for a selection of large projects and the accuracy of the VTA’s estimates for project costs and timelines.

Marc Berman,Becker and Berman Jointly Name Dr. Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga as Woman of the Year,2023-03-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced that they have jointly chosen Dr. Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga as the 13th Senate District and 23rd Assembly District Woman of the Year. Dr. Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga is the founder and executive director of Ayudando Latinos A Soñar (ALAS), a social service nonprofit and farmworker advocacy organization based in Half Moon Bay.
“Dr. Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga has been at the forefront supporting farmworkers and families, not only highlighting concerns like living conditions, mental wellness, economic prosperity, and broadband access, but providing solutions,"" said Senator Becker. ""Belinda has created a vibrant communal space with ALAS, and her collaboration with various partners enabled ALAS to expand their services to farms and ranches via the mobile resource center, the Farmworker Equity Express. Belinda embodies the best of California—vision, compassion, activism, hard work, humility and most of all a passion for social justice, which is why I am honored to partner with Assemblymember Marc Berman in choosing Belinda Arriaga as our Woman of the Year.” 
“For the first time that I am aware of, the same woman has been chosen as Woman of the Year by both an Assemblymember and a Senator. That tells you all you need to know about Belinda Hernandez-Arriaga and the exceptional contributions she has made to the community and the state of California,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Belinda is a champion for farmworker families in San Mateo County. She has worked for years to bring visibility to a population that far too often is overlooked in our county. When a mass shooting in Half Moon Bay shocked the entire nation, Belinda and her nonprofit ALAS stepped up to provide emergency services to the grieving farmworker community, many of whom Belinda and her colleagues at ALAS already had longstanding relationships with. Belinda is a voice for the most vulnerable among us and a model for service to one’s community.”
For years, ALAS has been serving the North San Mateo County Coast farmworker community, with a focus on cross-cultural collaboration and building special relationships among farmworker families. Belinda is an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco (USF) and founder/executive director of Ayudando Latinos A Soñar (ALAS), a Latino cultural arts, education, mental health and social justice program dedicated to working with rural youth and families living on the coastside. Belinda is a graduate from USF with a doctorate in education and master’s in social work. Belinda has done extensive work with farmworker families and their children, her mental health practice is focused on immigration trauma, u-visas, asylum and her current research prioritizes understanding the emotional, psychological and traumatic experiences that impact undocumented and mixed status Latino youth. A significant part of her work is dedicated to the cultural arts as part of cultural connections for healing. Belinda is committed to social justice advocacy, equity and human rights. She also co-founded the Latino Advisory Council in Half Moon Bay.
She and her husband have three daughters and live in Half Moon Bay.
Assemblymember Berman and Senator Becker presented Belinda with her award during her ALAS board meeting tonight. They will each honor her at their respective Senate and Assembly events in Sacramento later this month.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Protect Victims of Revenge Porn,2023-02-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Last week Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 1380, which will strengthen California’s laws against revenge porn. The bill closes a loophole in current law used by perpetrators to evade punishment for distributing private sexual images of another person, either photos or video, without their consent.
“Secretly taking pornographic photos or video of someone doesn’t make you cool. It makes you a coward. And when you get caught, you’ll get convicted,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Too often perpetrators of revenge porn leverage legal loopholes to get away with this heinous crime, leaving victims traumatized, humiliated, and without justice. AB 1380 will ensure that if you record and distribute another person’s sexually explicit images without their consent there will be legal consequences.”
“Revenge porn is not sexy. It’s not acceptable. It’s not legal. It’s a felony. If you secretly record sexual images of someone else and post them online one of your hits may be law enforcement. And we will prosecute you,” said Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen.
“The California District Attorneys Association thanks Assembly Member Berman for standing up for victims of revenge porn. It’s unacceptable to take private photos of someone without their consent or permission and anyone who does will face the consequences,” said Tulare County District Attorney and California District Attorney’s Association President Tim Ward.
Existing law does not prevent someone from secretly recording an explicit video or taking an explicit picture for the purpose of revenge, which can often be the motivation behind revenge porn. It also does not cover circumstances where a person distributes stolen videos or images. AB 1380 makes it clear that these actions are illegal.
Revenge porn is an increasingly common crime intended to shame and intimidate its victims. Victims often suffer additional harm such as threats of physical violence, stalking, and criminal threats.[1] A study by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative found that 93% of victims suffered significant emotional distress because of their victimization, 51% had suicidal thoughts, and 49% stated they had been stalked or harassed online by users who saw their explicit images.[2]

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Guarantee Access to Computer Science for all High School Students in California,2023-02-15,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 1054 which will ensure that all public high school students in California have access to computer science education. AB 1054 will align California with 27 other states that already require that public high schools offer computer science education.
""From Silicon Valley to Biotech Beach, California is the undisputed cradle of innovation. People move here from all across the globe with bold ideas and big dreams of changing the world,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""But the reality is that far too many California students grow up in the shadows of these tech companies, yet go to schools that don't even offer them the opportunity to learn the skills they need to one day work there."" 
""California has fallen behind 27 other states when it comes to prioritizing access to computer science education, exacerbating educational inequities and the diversity gaps in tech. This is indefensible. Not only will ensuring that every California high school student has access to computer science courses help close the gender and diversity gap in tech fields, it will also help train the future workforce needed for California to remain competitive both with other states and other nations. AB 1054 will begin to restore California as a leader, and will equip our students with the skills they need to succeed in tomorrow's digitally driven world,” said Assemblymember Berman.
 
Here's what leading computer science education advocates have to say:
“Ensuring all high schools offer at least one course in foundational computer science means that all students - regardless of their background, identity, or location - will have access to such important courses. It is for this reason that more than half of the states in the country have passed such a policy,"" Codeye J. Woody, Director of State Government Affairs for Code.org.
""Every student deserves to be equipped with the knowledge, tools, and resources to successfully participate and thrive in modern society. As technology continues to expand, today’s students need access to culturally relevant and engaging high quality computer science education. Unfortunately, too many students, particularly Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income students, don’t have access to these foundational learning opportunities. CSforCA firmly believes that by offering computer science courses at all California's high schools, we will get closer to achieving educational equity across the state and build a better future for everyone,"" said Julie Flapan, CSforCA Co-Director.
“California is a leader in innovation but lags behind in ensuring equity and access to computer science education. Requiring all high schools to offer at least one computer science course is a critical next step in preparing the next generation of Californians for rewarding career pathways and informed community engagement,” said Lia Nitake, Deputy Executive Director for TechNet.
“Computer science and computational thinking allow students to develop multiple skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving that can engage and drive our young adults to be the next generation of innovators. California needs to re-double its efforts to ensure all students have access to high-quality teaching and learning across all STEM subjects, including computer science. We look forward to working with Assembly member Berman to secure the additional commitments and support from the state to do just that,” said Adonai Mack, Senior Director of Education for Children Now.
“SVLG remains committed to fostering the next generation of STEM talent to sustain our innovation economy and create shared economic value for all. We support efforts designed to help ensure that all high school students, regardless of socioeconomic background, have access to essential computer science education. And believe that by doing so through a lens of equity, new doors of opportunity can be opened, and we can help change the face of Silicon Valley,” said Ahmad Thomas, CEO of Silicon Valley Leadership Group.
It is critically important to ensure all students in California have equitable access to computer science education. 75.1% of high school students in California attend a school that offers computer science, but despite years of work, significant disparities in access persist. Generally, students from racial and ethnic groups that have been historically excluded from computer science continue to be less likely to attend a school that offers it. Rural schools, urban schools, and schools with high percentages of economically disadvantaged students continue to be less likely to offer computer science. Black students, Latinx students, and Native American/Alaskan students are less likely to attend a school that offers computer science[1]. Computer science engages students in school, supports learning in other subject areas, and provides pathways for future opportunities for students.

Marc Berman,Berman to Crack Down on Surprise Hotel Fees,2023-02-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced the introduction of AB 537, which cracks down on hidden fees – what President Biden termed “junk fees” in his State of the Union speech last week - and requires that mandatory hotel and resort fees be disclosed in the advertised room rate.
“President Biden is right – Californians are tired of being played for suckers,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Surprise hotel fees are dishonest and misleading. You go to a website, enter the dates of your stay, pick a room for a certain price, enter your personal information, and then at the last minute the hotel or travel website tacks on resort or cleaning fees. We’ve all experienced it, and I’m tired of it. AB 537 will ensure that the advertised cost of your hotel stay is the real price you pay.”
“The other day I saw a hotel that tacked on a ‘destination fee’ at the very end of the booking process,” Berman added. “It’s a hotel! Being a destination isn’t a special add-on, it’s literally the essence of a hotel. How does that warrant a special hidden fee? Put that in the up-front price of the stay.”
""The Consumer Federation of California is proud to sponsor AB 537 and thank Assemblymember Berman for taking the lead on this basic pocketbook issue,"" said Robert Herrell, Executive Director of the Consumer Federation of California. ""Resort fees are becoming more common, more expensive, and more troublesome by the day. Many companies manipulate consumers and their internet searches into thinking they're getting a better deal than they really are. That's why states and jurisdictions like Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. have taken bipartisan legal actions against these often-times hidden fees. Consumers should know what they're getting and the complete price from the moment they start looking. That's just common sense and basic consumer protection.""
Over the last few years, deceptive advertising in the short-term lodging industry has significantly increased, with many hotels, motels, and other short-term lodging establishments not disclosing mandatory fees in advance. Some hotels charge separate mandatory “resort fees” or “cleaning fees”, but fail to disclose them until later in the booking process (once most consumers have committed to the property) or at “checkout”. According to an analysis by the Los Angeles Times, at least one thousand of the 40,000 Airbnb listings included in the study charged a cleaning fee that was only $10 less than the nightly rate. The study also found that 83% of short-term rentals in Los Angeles charged a cleaning fee which typically ranged from $5 to $1,500, with one fee as much as $2,500. Furthermore, this report showed that in 2018, across the U.S., hotels generated approximately $3 billion in mandatory hotel fees, an 8.5% increase compared to 2017.

Marc Berman,Elected Leaders Urge Immediate Repair and Reopening of State Route 92,2023-01-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA –Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman, Senator Josh Becker, and San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller issued the following statement in response to the closure of State Route 92 in Half Moon Bay due to a storm related sinkhole:
“Our full attention is on those impacted by the closure of Highway 92. I understand the impact of the closure on the residents that rely on the highway as a critical connection to the Peninsula. We have been in frequent communication with Caltrans, the California Highway Patrol, the affected cities, and the County. We will not let up until the road is repaired,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Caltrans has assured me that they are working around the clock to reopen the road and inspect other roadways in the area for similar dangers. I will do everything in my power to ensure that this remains a top Caltrans priority.”
“The enormous sinkhole that’s opened up on Highway 92 is the latest catastrophe stemming from the unprecedented winter storms that have taken their toll on everyone and seemingly everything in our region. Emergency crews are working around the clock to get the highway re-opened, but given how severe the damage is, it’s going to take some time. My office is working with Caltrans, CHP, the City of Half Moon Bay and the County of San Mateo to see if it’s possible to safely re-open Highway 92 before the sinkhole is completely repaired,” said State Senator Josh Becker.
“My office has been working with the County Executive’s Office and County Health and I have been informed contingency planning has been implemented to ensure emergency medical services and transport is operational to Coastside residents while the 92 is closed. I am grateful to Senator Becker and Assemblymember Berman and their offices for their assistance in working with CalTrans during this event,” said San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller.
Earlier today the California Congressional Delegation and staff met with the leadership of CalOES and FEMA where both Congresswoman Anna Eshoo and Congressman Kevin Mullin underscored to the agency’s leadership the critical need to reopen State Route 92 in both directions as soon as possible. FEMA confirmed the agency is working on a fix.
San Mateo County residents can sign up for emergency alerts at www.smcgov.org/ceo/smc-alert. Access real-time Caltrans traffic information layered on a Google Map at QuickMap (ca.gov). Check current highway conditions on your mobile phone at Road Conditions (ca.gov). You can also call 1-800-427-7623 for current highway conditions.

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to Governor Newsom’s Budget Proposal,2023-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) today released the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s January Budget proposal:
“The Governor’s January Budget proposal responsibly reflects our new uncertain economic reality. The positive news is that our fiscal prudence and preparation over the last few years will allow us to maintain existing investments both in the people of California and in critical infrastructure projects in our communities. Late last year, Moody’s identified California as one of the top-5 states most financially prepared for an economic downturn. Our prior judicious decisions will allow us to preserve our historic levels of public education funding and the progress we have made on the most important issues of our time.
“I applaud Governor Newsom’s commitment to addressing homelessness. The proposal makes it clear that we will continue to prioritize the state’s comprehensive homelessness strategy, while working to boost local accountability. This allocation includes $3 billion for Project Homekey, a program which has been successfully implemented by cities in my district. With additional funding we can continue to support our neighbors experiencing homelessness and transition them into permanent stable housing.
“I am also grateful that Governor Newsom’s budget proposal includes increased funding for levees and other flood protection efforts. These investments are timely and essential as my constituents face the reality of more devastating storms on the horizon while they are still recovering from the damage of the last ten days. Unpredictable and extreme weather is only going to become more commonplace and California must do more to protect our residents and our communities.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws",2022-12-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – In 2022 Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) authored nine new laws underscoring his continued commitment to transparent and accessible elections, his years of advocacy for students, and his determination to improve the quality of life for all Californians. Unless otherwise stated, all laws go into effect on January 1st, 2023:
Elections
Assembly Bill 2584 reforms the flawed local recall process. While recalls can be an important tool to hold elected officials accountable, this new law ensures that the process to initiate a recall is rigorous enough to demonstrate that it is a serious effort, rather than weaponizing the recall process for the sole purpose of impeding government from working. In addition, this bill will make sure that voters are provided accurate and truthful information, and that we do not waste limited public resources.
Assembly Bill 775 bans political candidates or committees from pre-checking the recurring donation box on their websites, and requires them to obtain affirmative consent before enrolling campaign donors in recurring contributions. California is one of only three states to pass legislation to ban this deceptive tactic ensuring that Californians are no longer tricked into making repeated and unintended donations. Automatically enroll donors in recurring payments at the time of an initial donation–often unbeknownst to the donor—had become increasingly popular in California and around the country.
Assembly Bill 972 extends until January 1, 2027, California’s current prohibition on distributing deepfakes and manipulated media of political candidates within 60 days of an election, unless labeled as manipulated. Assemblymember Berman authored the 2019 law to crack down on this use of deceptive deepfakes, requiring the creator disclose that the video has been manipulated if it pertains to a candidate or an election.
 
Higher Education
Assembly Bill 2881 grants priority registration for student parents, establishes a student parent webpage for each campus, and provides greater awareness to the California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The new law removes barriers that inhibit academic success and degree attainment for student parents at the community colleges, California State University campuses, and University of California campuses.
Assembly Bill 2815 requires California State University (CSU) campuses and requests University of California (UC) campuses to have one vote by mail ballot drop box location on each campus. The change will help ensure each CSU and UC student has access to a ballot drop box on campus. Voters between the ages of 18 to 24 are the most underrepresented among California’s voting electorate. Placing ballot drop boxes on college campuses is a simple but meaningful change that will elevate student voices and strengthen our democracy.
 
Projecting Consumers
Assembly Bill 2912 strengthens consumer warranty protections for Californians by requiring that warranties start on the date of delivery rather than the date of purchase. An express warranty guarantees a certain expectation of quality or functionality for a specific period of time. Yet, warranties have been wasted on backlogs and delayed deliveries as consumers regularly wait weeks or months for appliances to be delivered. This new law ensures that consumers receive the full benefit and duration of these warranties regardless of the type of product. This law goes into effect on July 1, 2023.
 
Supporting California’s Businesses
Assembly Bill 2307 eases caps on tasting rooms for California’s craft brewers. The new law increases the statutory limit of beer manufacturer duplicate and retail licenses in order to enable California’s award-winning craft breweries to better compete in a global marketplace for consumer awareness and popularity.
 
Budget Accomplishments:
Assemblymember Berman successfully championed nearly $20 million for infrastructure and affordable housing projects in his district in the 2022-23 Budget. These critical civic investments include a new community plaza in Pescadero, 136 homes for very low-income families in East Palo Alto, rebuilding an outdated fire station in Palo Alto, making needed improvements to recreational facilities in North Fair Oaks, and technological upgrades to the Caltrain corridor to reduce gate down times that block traffic. The investments highlight the enduring, successful partnership between local jurisdictions and the state.
Assemblymember Berman also secured funding and language in the 2022-23 Budget to create the Cybersecurity Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships Pilot Program through the California State University (CSU) to address the immediate cybersecurity workforce gap. The $4 million appropriation will increase the pipeline of students pursuing well-paying, high demand cybersecurity careers and develop the cybersecurity workforce to meet industry needs within local or regional economies.
Finally, Assemblymember Berman secured $5 million to better serve foster youth with substance use disorders. According to data from the National Youth in Transition Database, youth that have been in the foster care system are five times more likely to abuse drugs than their peers. The Administration for Children and Families reports that 27% of foster youth aged 17 have been referred for substance abuse treatment. This funding will establish a grant program to fund the development and implementation of evidence-based models and promising practices to better serve these foster youth in family-based settings, to prevent the need for congregate-level of care. Substance use can lead to foster youth being removed from their foster family and placed in a group home. Going from a stable-family setting to a congregate care setting can make positive outcomes harder to achieve for the youth.

Marc Berman,California Clamps Down on Deceptive Campaign Fundraising Tactic,2022-10-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation, Assembly Bill 775, to ban political candidates or committees from pre-checking the recurring donation box on their websites, and to require them to obtain affirmative consent before enrolling campaign donors in recurring contributions. California is one of only three states to pass legislation to ban this deceptive tactic.
“Hundreds of thousands of people were tricked into contributing over $122 million to Donald Trump’s campaign in 2020,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Trump was not the only candidate to use this tactic to trick donors into giving more than they wanted to. AB 775 will ensure that Californians are not misled by candidates who turn a single campaign donation into repeated contributions without their consent. Candidates should not rely on deception and trickery to raise money to fund their campaigns.”
“This bill will put an end to a scheme that hurt Californians who were simply exercising their right to support a cause or candidate of their choice,” said Fair Political Practices Commission Chair Richard C. Miadich. “AB 775 assures those who give their hard-earned money to a campaign they won’t be taken advantage of by unscrupulous political players.”
Pre-checked donation boxes that automatically enroll donors in recurring payments at the time of an initial donation–often unbeknownst to the donor—have become increasingly popular. A New York Times investigation found that former President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign made extensive use of pre-checked recurring donation boxes. As the campaign’s use of those boxes increased, the campaign also saw a spike in contribution refund requests. Ultimately, the Trump campaign had to refund nearly 11% of the funds that it raised through its online platform, totaling more than $122 million.
AB 775 specifically states that “passive action by the contributor, such as failing to uncheck a pre-checked box authorizing a recurring contribution, does not meet the requirement of affirmative consent.” In addition, the bill requires a candidate or committee that accepts a recurring contribution to provide a receipt for each contribution, to provide information necessary to cancel the recurring contribution, and to immediately cancel a recurring contribution upon request.
AB 775 received unanimous support in the Legislature and was supported by the Fair Political Practices Commission, California Common Cause, the Consumer Federation of California, and the League of Women Voters of California.

Marc Berman,California to Remove Barriers for College Students with Children,2022-09-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation today to support student parents at community colleges, California State University (CSU), and University of California (UC). Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), AB 2881 will remove barriers to degree attainment for student parents and bring greater attention to their needs.
“The journey to and through college is challenging for many students, but it is even more difficult for the over 202,000 college students in California who are also parents,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Not only must most student parents balance working while also going to school, but they must also juggle their child’s schedule. The disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the needs of student parents, whose challenges multiplied as school and child care interruptions put even greater demands on their time and attention. AB 2881 will give student parents priority registration and other critical supports so they can achieve their educational dreams while raising a family.”
""As an undergraduate and a parent, I struggled to stay enrolled in college and dropped out twice before returning. I benefited from priority registration due to my low-income status and learning disability. But not all students qualify. AB 2881 will help the most underrepresented students who are already at a high risk of dropping out of college. It will help create a successful future for their children and future generations as well,"" said CSU Fullerton student Maria Linares.
“We applaud Governor Newsom and Assemblymember Berman for recognizing the extraordinary challenges experienced by student parents as they shoulder family responsibilities while pursuing their college education. AB 2881 will provide much-needed assistance with class scheduling while connecting them with additional resources that will be helpful as they continue their studies and work towards securing rewarding careers,"" said Miguel Leon, Director of Programs and Strategic Initiatives for the Michelson Center for Public Policy.
“As a national advocacy organization that works to uplift young adults, we at Young Invincibles believe that access to priority registration through AB 2881 will significantly expedite student parents’ coursework completion and will enable them to build a better, more financially stable life for themselves and their families. As proud co-sponsors of AB 2881, we are ready for the positive effect that this policy will have on the many student parents that are currently balancing the deeply demanding needs of parenting and continuing education. We thank Assemblymember Marc Berman for his authorship and continued support of marginalized students.”
A March 2021 research brief from Wheelhouse at the University of California, Davis, examined the student parent population and found that among the nearly 1.5 million California college and university students who applied for financial aid in 2018, over 202,000 were student parents, representing 13.4 percent. Moreover, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that student parents are almost twice as likely to leave college without a degree after six years. Among students of color, a higher proportion are parenting while in college: 33 percent of Black students, 30 percent of Native American students, and 21 percent of Latinx students have children. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research also found that student parents face greater economic barriers than students without children: over two-thirds of student parents live in or near poverty, and student parents have higher levels of unmet financial need and higher median student debt.
To support student parents in reaching their educational goals, AB 2881 grants priority registration to a student parent who has children under 18 years of age who will receive more than half of their support from that student, establishes a student parent webpage for every campus highlighting available services and resources, and provides greater awareness to the California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC), the Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC), and the California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program). Parental education level has been linked to the academic and economic success of their children. As a result, supporting student parents will have a ripple effect by also uplifting their children.
AB 2881 passed out of the Legislature with unanimous support, and is co-sponsored by the Michelson Center for Public Policy, the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, and Young Invincibles.

Marc Berman,California to Reform Flawed Recall System,2022-09-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Last night, Governor Newsom signed AB 2584, Assemblymember Marc Berman’s bill that will make good governance reforms to our recall process.
“It is far too easy to initiate a recall in California, wasting taxpayer dollars and distracting local elected officials from being able to serve their communities” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “While recalls can be an important tool to hold elected officials accountable, AB 2584 will ensure that the process to initiate a recall is rigorous enough to demonstrate that it is a serious effort, rather than weaponizing the recall process for the sole purpose of impeding government from working. In addition, this bill will make sure that voters are provided accurate and truthful information, and that we don't waste limited public resources.”
“The process for local recall elections is currently open to gamesmanship that undermines the democratic process,” said Stephanie Doute, Executive Director of the League of Women Voters of California. “AB 2584 will help protect against frivolous recall elections, provide voters with accurate information, maximize community participation in government decision making, increase transparency, and boost participation by consolidating special elections.”
“AB 2584 better reflects the popular will by raising the initial signature threshold for a special election to a higher, but still reasonable and readily achievable total,” said California School Boards Association (CSBA) President Dr. Susan Heredia. “This bill will increase transparency for voters by applying the same accuracy standards to petition statements that is required of information in other election contests. Finally, AB 2584 will reduce the cost to taxpayers of holding multiple, redundant elections, often within the span of a few months. These are all common sense steps to help make the election process more responsive to the interests of voters and we thank Asm. Berman for authoring this CSBA-sponsored bill, the Legislature for passing it, and Gov. Newsom for signing it into law.” 
Nearly a year ago, California held a statewide recall election. That election raised questions about whether a system designed in the early 20th century has enough checks and balances to ensure a democratic and fair process. As a result, last fall the Assembly and Senate Elections Committees conducted a series of bipartisan hearings on the recall process.
The committees evaluated recall laws in other states, and invited experts to examine California’s recall process. The committee heard from a variety of witness from academia, government, and the public on the need to retain recalls as an important tool to hold elected officials accountable. But it also heard of the need for statutory procedural reforms.
AB 2584 would make four distinct procedural changes to state and local recalls. It will address the signature threshold to initiate a recall, extend accuracy standards to the statement of reason and response for a recall, enhance the information provided to recall petition signers regarding the potential fiscal impact of school district-related recall elections, and allow additional opportunities to consolidate a local recall election with a regularly scheduled election. Importantly, these updates can be made without fundamentally altering or undermining the public’s ability to hold their government accountable.

Marc Berman,California to Streamline the Oversight of Affordable Housing,2022-09-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today the Governor signed AB 2006, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will streamline the oversight of affordable housing developments in California. AB 2006 will require the three state agencies which currently conduct oversight over affordable housing developments to enter into a memorandum of understanding to coordinate their compliance monitoring.
“AB 2006 will eliminate duplicative work so that affordable housing developers can spend more time and money building affordable housing, not filling out compliance forms,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “California has made important advancements to increase our housing supply by streamlining the finance system for affordable housing developments. It is time to make our state’s oversight system more efficient as well.”
“By eliminating duplication in monitoring efforts, AB 2006 saves the state money and reduces the cost of affordable housing,” said Matt Schwartz, President and CEO of the California Housing Partnership, “These savings in turn can support additional affordable homes. This common-sense measure is long overdue.”
“This common-sense legislation will make the work of the state and affordable housing providers easier and more efficient, while helping focus resources where they should be: On providing safe, affordable housing for our residents,” said Ray Pearl, Executive Director of the California Housing Consortium.
Affordable housing developments frequently receive financing from more than one state entity, leading to multiple state entities conducting duplicate and overlapping compliance monitoring. Currently, the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the California Housing and Finance Agency (CalHFA), and the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) provide compliance monitoring on affordable housing developments. With the passage of AB 2006, these state entities will be coordinating their efforts and streamlining this process by eliminating the submittal of duplicate information, ensuring only one state entity conducts physical inspections for a particular project, and providing an aligned process to obtain required approvals. AB 2006, sponsored by the California Housing Consortium and the California Housing Partnership, will finally simplify this process and modernize an unnecessarily burdensome bureaucratic process.

Marc Berman,Berman Bill Will Put Vote by Mail Drop Boxes on California University Campuses,2022-09-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Last night the Governor signed AB 2815, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which ensures that voting is accessible for students attending public universities. AB 2815 requires all California State University (CSU) campuses and requests University of California (UC) campuses to have a vote by mail (VBM) ballot drop box location on campus.
“Young people will live the longest with the decisions made by their elected officials, so it is imperative that we make it easier for them to exercise their right to vote,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Voters between the ages of 18 to 24 are the most underrepresented among California’s voting electorate. Placing ballot drop boxes on college campuses is a simple but meaningful change that will elevate student voices and strengthen our democracy.”
“The recent passage of AB 2815, which mandates counties to provide a mail-in ballot drop off location at all CSU campuses, will improve the accessibility of thousands of students across California to all statewide elections,” said Trent Murphy, California State Student Association Vice President of Legislative Affairs and student at Stanislaus State. “The California State Student Association is proud to support the passage of this bill. No longer will a student in the CSU system have to forgo exercising their right to vote because of transportation, health, or extenuating circumstances.”
“We are excited by the recent passing of AB 2815 which would require California State Universities and request the University of California system to have a vote-by-mail location on their campus. This is a major step forward for expanding access to voting, especially amongst college-aged students,” said Young Invincibles West Advocacy Manager Sarah Bouabibsa. “As a national advocacy organization that seeks to amplify the voices of young adults in the political process, Young Invincibles is proud to continue our work on voter expansion through policies like AB 2815 that will meet students where they are and ensure that they can exercise their right to have their voice heard. We thank Assemblymember Marc Berman for continuing to utilize his leadership as a tool for empowering students.”
With the passage of AB 2815, when students are on campus, there will be a VBM ballot drop box accessible on campus for all statewide elections.

Marc Berman,"Warranties in California Will Begin on Date of Delivery, Not Date of Purchase",2022-09-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Gavin Newsom signed consumer protection legislation that will, beginning on July 1, 2023, require all express warranties to start no earlier than the date of delivery rather than the date of purchase. An express warranty guarantees a certain expectation of quality or functionality for a specific period of time. Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), AB 2912 will ensure that consumers receive the full benefit and duration of these warranties regardless of the type of consumer product.
“It makes no sense for a warranty to begin at the time of purchase if the product takes days, weeks, or even months to arrive,” said Assemblymember Berman. “This was a problem before the pandemic, but has only grown more evident with supply chain issues. AB 2912 is a win for consumers and will ensure that Californians receive the entire guaranteed length of their warranty. I am grateful that Governor Newsom signed AB 2912, making California one of the first states—if not the first state in the nation—to require all express warranties to begin on the date of delivery for every consumer product.”
The pandemic and supply chain issues have highlighted the need for change to protect consumers. For example, if a consumer buys a product with a one-year warranty, but the consumer does not receive the product for six months, then the consumer has essentially lost half of the warranty.
There is precedent for having warranties begin on the date of delivery. Carpet installers, for example, typically operate this way. Additionally, in California warranties for wheelchairs and hearing aids are already required to start from the date of delivery. While other states similarly have warranties for specific products begin on the delivery date, California now goes further to provide this consumer protection for any product that has an express warranty. 
AB 2912 received bipartisan support in the Legislature and was supported by numerous consumer protection organizations.

Marc Berman,State’s Homekey 2.0 Program Awards $26.6 Million to City of Palo Alto,2022-08-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to the announcement that the City of Palo received $26.6 million from the state Homekey program to build and operate a shelter to house community members experiencing homelessness in partnership with LifeMoves:

Marc Berman,Berman Honors Local Fallen Hero and Navy Cross Recipient with Highway Designation,2022-08-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assembly Concurrent Resolution 151, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), has been chaptered by the California Secretary of State. ACR 151 designates a portion of State Route 280 in Santa Clara County as the “Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway.” ACR 151 was chaptered shortly after the 10th anniversary of Manoukian’s death, which was August 10, 2022. 
“Captain Manoukian’s heart for service and desire to leave the world in a better place than he found it represents the best our country has to offer,” Assemblymember Berman said. “To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Captain Manoukian’s ultimate sacrifice to our country, the Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway honors his legacy of unwavering bravery, courageous leadership and extraordinary heroism.” 
Supported by the Marine Raider Foundation, the Rotary Club of Los Altos, Saint Francis High School, and dozens of families and statewide and community organizations, ACR 151 designates the portion of California State Route 280 in Los Altos Hills between postmarker 10.741 and postmarker 14.844 to honor and commemorate Captain Manoukian’s service to his community and country.
Captain Manoukian grew up in Los Altos Hills with his parents, The Honorable Socrates Peter Manoukian and The Honorable Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian, and two younger brothers, Michael and Martin. His paternal grandfather was a survivor of the Armenian genocide and started a new life in the United States, making sure Matthew understood the costs of unchecked oppression. 
“Our dearly beloved son, Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian, loved his family and friends, loved his Marines, loved his country, and loved serving in the United States Marine Corps — bringing hope, freedom and peace to the world. Matthew gave his life for all he loved,” said his mother, Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian. “Matthew will never be forgotten, and I know that his ‘sacrifice will live on forever in the hearts of all who cherish freedom.’”
At 7-years-old, Manoukian determined he would one day serve those in need by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, and he never wavered from his childhood dream. In January of 2006, Manoukian entered the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, VA, and later went on to graduate from Marine Special Operations Command among the top tier of Marine Raiders who completed the program.
“Matt was a natural leader who knew how to bring people from all walks of life together,” said his brother, Dr. Martin Manoukian. “He expected nothing but the best of himself, brought out the best in others, and elevated the performance of everyone around him.” 
Captain Manoukian served two deployments to Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan. While preparing for his first tour of duty in Iraq, Manoukian voraciously studied the cultures of the Middle East and learned to speak Arabic. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, Manoukian led efforts focused on bringing stability and security to the respective regions—working with local leaders to establish judicial systems and police forces and unifying local village leadership with district level governance. 
""Captain Matt led from the front and led by example,” said his father, Socrates Peter Manoukian. “He never ordered his Marines to do anything that he would not do and did not do himself. He made every Marine feel important to the success of the mission and earned their respect and trust.”
On August 10, 2012, the Marine Tactical Operations Center where Captain Manoukian was working came under automatic small arms fire from a rogue Afghan uniformed policeman attacking from inside the perimeter. In the face of a near certain death, Captain Manoukian drew his pistol and engaged the attacker while commanding his Marines to maneuver to safety. Captain Manoukian courageously drew heavy fire upon himself and engaged the enemy until he fell mortally wounded from the shooter's overwhelming fire. Captain Manoukian’s bold and decisive actions assisted in halting the gunman's assault and forced him to withdraw, enabling Captain Manoukian’s fellow Marines to survive. 
In 2014, Captain Manoukian, who was affectionately referred to by the locals as Captain Haidar (meaning “Lion”), was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the Marine Corps’ second-highest award for bravery, for his heroic and selfless actions of exposing himself to enemy fire, thereby allowing his fellow Marines to escape and save their lives. 
“The Manoukian family extends a heartfelt thank you to Assemblymember Berman for his leadership on ACR 151,” said his brother, Michael Manoukian. “The Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway will forever enshrine Captain Manoukian’s legacy, and the Manoukian family hopes that the Highway will inspire people to give their all to the efforts they are passionate about in life.” 
ACR 151 passed out of the California State Legislature with unanimous support and was chaptered into law on Friday, August 19, 2022, shortly after the 10th anniversary of Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian’s ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) was a co-author of ACR 151.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Secures $19.6 million for District in 2022-23 State Budget,2022-06-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) secured nearly $20 million for infrastructure and affordable housing projects in the 24th Assembly District in the 2022-23 Budget, which the Legislature passed this evening. In addition to the significant long-term investments in his district, Assemblymember Berman also secured $4 million to create a pilot program to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage and $5 million to improve treatment options for foster youth with substance use disorders.
“This year I secured my largest district funding package ever, totaling $19.6 million in investments to boost the affordability, safety, and vibrancy of the 24th Assembly District for decades to come,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “These critical civic investments include a new community plaza in Pescadero, 136 homes for very low-income families in East Palo Alto, rebuilding an outdated fire station in Palo Alto, making needed improvements to recreational facilities in North Fair Oaks, and technological upgrades to the Caltrain corridor to reduce gate down times that block traffic. These investments highlight the enduring, successful partnership between local jurisdictions and the state.”
In addition to funding for projects in the 24th Assembly District, the Budget includes record spending on both K-12 and higher education, childcare, addressing the housing and homelessness crisis, and critical transportation and infrastructure improvements. In addition, the budget will include a $17 billion statewide inflation relief package, while also adding $12 billion to budget reserves, bringing total reserves up to $37 billion. With this agreement, twenty-three million Californians will receive direct payments of up to $1,050. For a family of four, a $1,050 check will cover the cost of inflation for groceries for roughly two years.
“These investments will have a real, tangible impact on hundreds of thousands of constituents in my district and tens of millions of people across California,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “This budget will fund our state’s global leadership in combatting climate change, it will build student housing at our UC & CSU campuses, it will provide urgently needed mental health services, strengthen and expand wildfire defenses, and break records for education funding. It is an investment in our future—an investment full of both hope and pragmatism. I am proud to support this historic Budget tonight.”
 
$8 million to the City of East Palo Alto to create 136 homes for low-income families
965 Weeks Street is a critically important housing project for the City of East Palo Alto that will provide 136 affordable homes for low-income families. It is deeply affordable—averaging 45% of AMI— which aligns with the needs in the City, where incomes of residents are lower than in any other place in San Mateo County.
“To see this level of collaboration recognized with crucial gap-closing funding is gratifying,” said Duane Bay, Executive Director of EPACANDO. “The result, transforming a vacant, City-owned parcel, will be transformational for 136 households as well.”
“We thank Assemblymember Berman for his advocacy on behalf of the future residents of 965 Weeks Street,” said Matt Franklin, President and CEO of MidPen Housing. “Due to his incredible commitment and effective work, we are one giant step closer to making our vision to develop new homes for East Palo Alto families a reality.”
The project ranges from studios to 4-bedroom homes for families of all sizes, and 8 homes will serve homeless households referred to and served by the County’s Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. The project is located on donated land and over $23 million of County, City and other local funds have already been committed. While the state’s recent Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities award of $19.8 million got the project closer to starting construction, there remained a final financing hurdle to cross before the project and the planned housing and transportation improvements could be built. The $8 million in state funding helps to fill that gap.
$5.2 million for the City of Palo Alto to replace Fire Station 4
This allocation will fund rebuilding Fire Station 4, located at the corner of Middlefield Road and East Meadow Drive in Palo Alto. A study commissioned by the City of Palo Alto found that the station, built in 1953, fails to meet the California building code, as well as the National Fire Protection Association and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. This funding will ensure the new facility will be fully operational and able to effectively serve the community after a major disaster, such as a significant earthquake, fire, or other natural disaster.
“I want to thank Assembly Member Berman for his leadership in securing much needed funding for Fire Station #4,” said Palo Alto Mayor Pat Burt. “Improvements to this station have been a community priority to ensure our public safety and emergency medical personnel have the modern and seismically secure facilities they need. The City of Palo Alto greatly appreciates the hard work and longtime commitment of Assembly Member Berman toward critical public safety infrastructure.”
$3 million for the Caltrain Wireless Optimized Crossing System
This project will provide major benefits to the safety, mobility, and economic development of the region. Implementing a wireless optimized crossing system will reduce gate down time at grade crossings along the Caltrain corridor. Reduction in gate down times will maintain run times for Caltrain and will facilitate greater vehicle throughput at crossings. Greater operational flexibility for Caltrain will support the agency’s 2040 Service Vision which calls for increased service, frequency, and longer trains. The Service Vision projects ridership growth to almost triple to 180,000 daily riders. Ridership growth of this magnitude would eliminate 825,000 car trips and 110 metric tons of carbon emissions every day, and would put an estimated 5.5 lanes worth of commuter traffic onto Caltrain instead of the region’s highways
$2 million for the Pescadero Community Plaza Project
This funding, in partnership with San Mateo County, will build a community plaza in the heart of Pescadero, which will not only provide a space to gather for residents, but also provide a potential space for tourists and California residents to access information and recreation while on the San Mateo County coast. The unincorporated community of Pescadero has many natural assets including farmlands, two major creeks supporting endangered species, and beaches providing recreational opportunities for up to 10,000 visitors each week, but it does not have a permanent place for community members to connect and celebrate together. There is currently no community center or public plaza, and there are no spaces for families to gather and interact outside of the few restaurants. There are also few opportunities for children and teens to socialize outside of school and sports. In 2019, the community of Pescadero convened a Town Planning Process, among the top priorities identified was the need for a public space where community members can freely come together.
$1.4 million for the Fair Oaks School turf and light replacement
The Fair Oaks School Field is located in a significantly underserved area in San Mateo County. This field is the only recreational amenity in the neighborhood and is in dire need of replacement. In partnership with Redwood City, San Mateo County, and the Redwood City School District, this funding will replace the crumb rubber infill with new organic material for cooler field temperatures. The new LED field light system will also save energy costs, while the synthetic turf field will continue to save nearly 2 million gallons of water each year. This funding will enable both youth and adults to continue to benefit from this recreational amenity.
$5 million to better serve foster youth with substance use disorders
According to data from the National Youth in Transition Database, youth that have been in the foster care system are five times more likely to abuse drugs than their peers. The Administration for Children and Families reports that 27% of foster youth aged 17 have been referred for substance abuse treatment. This funding will establish a grant program to fund the development and implementation of evidence-based models and promising practices to better serve these foster youth in family-based settings, to prevent the need for congregate-level of care. Substance use can lead to foster youth being removed from their foster family and placed in a group home. Going from a stable-family setting to a congregate care setting can make positive outcomes harder to achieve for the youth.
$4 million to establish a pilot program to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage
This allocation will establish the Cybersecurity Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships Pilot Program through the California State University (CSU) to address the immediate cybersecurity workforce gap. The pilot program will bring together stakeholders in the cybersecurity ecosystem to align the workforce needs of employers with the education and training provided by institutions of higher education. This will increase the pipeline of students pursuing well-paying, high demand cybersecurity careers and develop the cybersecurity workforce to meet industry needs within local or regional economies.

Marc Berman,"Berman, Vice Mayor Jones Announce Agreement on VTA Governance Reform",2022-06-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and San José Vice Mayor and current VTA Board Chair Chappie Jones jointly call for a state audit of the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority’s (VTA) governance structure, fiscal management, and project planning and monitoring. Assemblymember Berman will postpone his current legislative reform efforts in lieu of the audit and in anticipation of recommendations from the State Auditor. Should the audit identify structural deficiencies and recommend reforms, both Assemblymember Berman and Chair Jones call upon VTA to have the difficult conversations necessary to propose state legislation to address the audit’s recommendations. 
“Over the last 20 years, three Civil Grand Jury Reports, multiple consultants hired by VTA, and a 2008 State Audit have called for structural reform of VTA,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I have spoken with every member of the board who was willing to meet with me – most of them multiple times. Almost all of them acknowledge the significant deficiencies in the current governance structure. Yet at the end of the day, I have been severely disappointed by the board’s unwillingness to address the real problems, including the lack of transparency in how some members are selected and the revolving door of members that are forced off of the board just as they are starting to understand how VTA works.”
“The State Auditor will be able to look beyond individual interests to provide a cohesive, apolitical set of recommendations for VTA to use to lead the important conversation of governance reform,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I am grateful for Vice Mayor Jones’ partnership in our shared endeavor to create a transparent, experienced, and regionally focused board of directors.”
“I appreciate Assemblymember Berman’s leadership and good faith effort to collaborate with various stakeholders on this initiative. As Chair of VTA, I recognize that this alternative approach is an opportunity to provide the objective information and data needed to propose timely reforms rooted in thorough analysis and evaluation of best practices,” noted Vice Mayor Jones. “Like with any other organization, there is always room for improvement. I look forward to the recommendations that emerge from this audit for consideration by the VTA Board and staff and encourage their action.”
According to the 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, VTA’s operating performance has continued to deteriorate over the last 10 years, relative to both its own historical performance and the performance of its peers, across a wide variety of metrics. Notwithstanding numerous reviews confirming structural barriers to success, many of these barriers have not yet been addressed.
VTA’s own 2021 Board Self-Assessment, which interviewed board members, states that board members felt that “cities or agencies often select a VTA representative based upon that individual’s interest in higher elected office, and not on their interest in and familiarity with transportation.”
Last week a diverse group of elected leaders joined Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian in supporting Assemblymember Berman’s effort to improve the governance structure of VTA. Along with meeting with the current VTA board, over the last two years Assemblymember Berman met with former board members, dozens of city councilmembers, city staff, VTA staff, transit riders, transit experts, and advocates. He spoke to the VTA Policy Advisory Committee and the Santa Clara County Cities Association, and held a public VTA Governance Town Hall, which can be viewed here.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Announces Coalition of Support for VTA Governance Reform,2022-06-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced support from a regional coalition of elected leaders and former VTA board members, led by Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian, for the need to achieve meaningful, structural reform of the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority’s (VTA) governing board.
“This diverse group of elected leaders recognize that we can’t keep on defending the status quo, which has proven to be ineffective in meeting the transit needs of VTA riders, VTA staff, and Santa Clara County tax payers,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I am grateful to these current and former elected officials, many of whom are former VTA board members themselves, who are committed to the difficult work of improving the governance structure of VTA. I am proud to join them in rejecting an opaque selection process, high turnover, parochial thinking, and lack of experience on a board which oversees billions of dollars of taxpayer money.”
The signatories are joined in their call for structural reform by three Civil Grand Jury Reports, consultants hired by VTA to evaluate their board structure, and a 2008 state audit. VTA’s own 2021 Board Self-Assessment, which interviewed board members directly, states that “cities or agencies often select a VTA representative based upon that individual’s interest in higher elected office, and not on their interest in and familiarity with transportation.”
According to the 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, the third in 20 years, VTA’s operating performance has continued to deteriorate over the last 10 years, relative to both its own historical performance and the performance of its peers, across a wide variety of metrics. Yet, in the face of this deterioration, the VTA board has refused to take significant action to reform the governance structure. For example, a state audit in 2008 highlighted one of the key pillars of Assemblymember Berman’s reform effort: lack of stability. The auditor wrote, “to promote stability in its leadership and to bring the tenure of VTA board members in line with comparable transit agencies, VTA should request the Legislature to amend its enabling statutes to allow for a four-year board term.” VTA did not accept the recommendation. Then in 2021, VTA’s own consultant recommended that VTA “increase director terms to four years.” Once again VTA rejected the recommendation. Even as they rejected measures to reduce turnover, VTA’s 2021 Board Self-Assessment reported that “most [board] members caution that VTA presents a steep learning curve for most members, and observe that some elected members never fully understand the complexities of VTA operations.”

Re: AB 2181(Berman) – Valley Transportation Authority – SUPPORT in Concept
Dear Chair Gonzalez:
We write to express our support for reforming the governance structure of Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). AB 2181, which seeks to increase transparency, regionalism, stability, and expertise on the board, is a critically important effort that is timelier than ever. While we know that the specifics of the bill are still being worked out with stakeholders, we support the pillars of this effort and are committed to continuing to work with Assemblymember Berman to reach a solution that better serves our county.
VTA has faced declining operating performance and structural financial deficits, which have been investigated by three Civil Grand Juries, a State Audit, and numerous consultants over the last eighteen years. In 2019, the Civil Grand Jury stated that “today, more so than in 2004 or 2009, the VTA Board is in need of structural change to enable it to better protect the interests of the County’s taxpayers and address the many complex challenges presented by emerging trends in transportation, rapidly evolving technology, and the changing needs of Silicon Valley residents.” The Grand Jury, like the State Auditor, recommended that VTA propose legislation to restructure the governing board, which is enshrined in state statute. VTA has still not done that.
Santa Clara County transit riders, residents, and taxpayers deserve a VTA board that has the time and expertise to provide high quality direction and oversight of VTA. They also deserve to know how their VTA representatives are selected. For these reasons and more, we support AB 2181 moving forward so as to continue the reform conversation. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Joe Simitian, Santa Clara County Supervisor

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to Governor’s May Revision Budget Proposal,2022-05-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s revised budget:
This year California has a remarkable opportunity to make transformative investments that will shape the lives of Californians for decades. I commend the Governor for laying out a forward-thinking plan in his May Revision of the budget that prioritizes rebuilding California through massive infrastructure investments and I look forward to these investments reaching my district.
In particular, I applaud the Governor’s proposed investments in combating climate change, with a significant focus on drought, historic funding to transform public education, with additional investments to address the urgent crisis of youth mental health, and unprecedented funding to combat California’s most critical issue: homelessness. I look forward to reviewing in more detail the proposals he laid out today as the Legislature works to adopt a budget for the next fiscal year.""

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Statement on Draft U.S. Supreme Court Opinion on Roe V. Wade,2022-05-03,press_release,NA,"Five members of the Supreme Court are set to unleash an historic attack on women's rights by allowing conservative state legislatures dominated by white men to deny women access to abortions. Such an action will disproportionately impact women of color, young women, and poor women who are less able to travel out of state to seek safe and legal medical services. This is what the Republican Party has been fighting to accomplish for decades, and they won't stop here - their next targets will be same-sex marriage and a woman's right to contraception. These are issues that are supported by strong majorities of Americans, but they are under attack by Republican politicians and the judges they have appointed.
California has long defended a woman’s fundamental right to choose to bear a child or to choose to obtain an abortion, and has strongly supported the institutions that provide safe abortions for women. No federal action or Supreme Court decision will shake our state’s defense of the right to access legal and safe abortion services.

Marc Berman,Berman Bill to Increase the Number of Computer Science Teachers Passes First Hurdle,2022-04-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to AB 1853 passing out of the Assembly Education Committee today. The legislation would establish the Computer Science Preservice Teacher Grant Program for California teacher preparation programs to develop or expand computer science education training for individuals seeking a teaching credential.
“Every student in California deserves access to high quality computer science education, but the majority of high schools in our state do not offer it,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Computer science is transforming industry, bolstering productivity in established economic sectors, and driving job creation and innovation throughout California’s economy. AB 1853 seeks to take an important step in ensuring all students have access to computer science education by increasing the number of teachers qualified to teach computer science in K-12 schools.”
Only 41% of California public high schools offer at least one computer science course with schools reporting a lack of trained teachers and funds as key barriers to offering computer science. California ranks 42nd nationally in high schools offering computer science courses. AB 1853 would create the Computer Science Preservice Teacher Grant, an incentive grant program, for institutions of higher education to develop or expand K–12 computer science and computational thinking coursework in teacher preparation programs. Preparing future or preservice teachers to teach and integrate computer science is a critical step in California’s efforts to expand computer science education to all students.
Nationwide computing occupations make up 58% of all projected new jobs in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, making computer science one of the most in-demand college majors. The United States of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook projects that computer and information technology occupations will grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations. California currently has approximately 68,000 open computing jobs with an average salary of $115,754.
Supporters of AB 1853 include Code.org (sponsor), Amazon, College Board, Council for Strong America, CSforCA, Elementary Computing for All, Fight Crime Invest in Kids, Project Lead the Way, Microsoft, Mission Readiness, Ready Nation, Snap, TechNet, and Valley Industry Commerce Association.
“Expanding access to computer science education for K-12 students starts with a strong pipeline of teachers,” said Robyn Hines, Senior Director State Government Affairs. “Microsoft is proud to support AB 1853 to create a Computer Science Preservice Teacher Grant Program for institutions of higher education because we believe in investing in the unlimited potential of California’s teachers and students.”
“Tackling educational inequity is the first step in diversifying the tech industry at scale,"" said Oona King, Snap VP of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. ""This also reflects the view of over 25 tech industry and academic experts that Snap convened to publish the Action to Catalyze Tech Report. We're proud to support AB 1853 as a meaningful investment in teachers to expand access to computer science education and equip students with the technical skills to succeed.”
“Growing the K-12 computer science pre-service pipeline is a foundational strategy for bringing computer science to our schools. Pre-service teachers are the next generation of education leaders and are positioned to teach foundational computer science skills for a workforce that now demands these skills. We strongly support Assemblymember Berman’s legislation.” said Cameron Wilson, President of Code.org a national nonprofit focused on ensuring every student has access to computer science education.

Marc Berman,Berman Names East Palo Alto Councilmember Lisa Gauthier as Woman of the Year,2022-03-17,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced that East Palo Alto Councilmember Lisa Gauthier is the 24th Assembly District ‘Woman of the Year’. As a way to highlight outstanding women during Women’s History Month, legislators select one exceptional woman from each Assembly District to honor for her contributions to the community and the state of California. Lisa Gauthier, Vice President of Partner Success at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, is an elected Council Member and former two-time Mayor of the City of East Palo Alto in the 24th Assembly District.
“I am so excited to recognize Councilmember Lisa Gauthier as Woman of the Year from the 24th Assembly District,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I have seen firsthand Lisa’s extraordinary commitment to serving her constituents, from volunteering almost every night at food distributions to working with community partners to increase access to vaccines and address underlying factors that create vaccine hesitancy in underserved communities. Lisa has been a good friend since we were first elected to neighboring city councils in 2012, and I’m so grateful for her selfless dedication to the residents of East Palo Alto.”
Councilmember Gauthier is inspired by the quote from Mother Teresa, “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacted the members of her community, Councilmember Gauthier went above and beyond to do everything she could to meet the daily needs of her constituents. In addition to her professional and city council duties, Councilmember Gauthier was an almost daily fixture at the nightly meal distribution at the Boys & Girls Club site in East Palo Alto. In addition, she worked closely with public and private entities to bring vaccine clinics into East Palo Alto, helping increase awareness and alleviate concerns that residents had about getting the vaccine and making it as easy as possible for people to get vaccinated.
“Showing up for others is something that is important to me,” said Councilmember Gauthier. “The work that impacts our communities does not happen in silos; it takes the work of many. I am grateful for the opportunity to assist where I can. In the end, I probably get more out of the community interaction than I give.”
Councilmember Gauthier is an active board member with the Health Trust, Live in Peace, the City and County Association of Governments of San Mateo County (C/CAG), San Mateo County Office of Emergency Services, Stanford Medicine Community Council, San Mateo County Flood and Sea Level Rise Resiliency Agency, and the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority. She is a graduate of Emerge, a leadership program for democratic women, and a Regional Area Director for Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA). Councilmember Gauthier was awarded the Athena Award from the Mountain View Chamber of Commerce in 2018 and was one of the recipients of the of Silicon Valley’s 100 Women of Influence award for 2020 by Silicon Valley Business Journal.
Councilmember Gauthier is the proud mother of three young adults, a longtime resident of East Palo Alto, and an active community volunteer.
Assemblymember Berman will present Councilmember Gauthier with her award at a private event later this month.

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Governor Newsom’s State of the State Address,2022-03-09,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) issued the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s State of the State address:
“I applaud Governor Newsom’s bold commitment to creating solutions to California's greatest challenges. As California recovers from the pandemic, we must prioritize an equitable recovery for all. I look forward to continuing to work with Governor Newsom and my colleagues in the Legislature to address the homelessness crisis, pass critically important housing affordability policies, expand access to early learning, bolster mental health services, and urgently address the present and future impacts of climate change. As democracy is under attack, both across the world and here in America, California must continue to show that we can expand access to a safe and secure ballot. We have a lot of work to do as we grapple with the continuing effects of the pandemic, but I know we will make progress this year on California’s biggest challenges, statewide and in the 24th Assembly District.”

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to California Supreme Court Ruling on UC Berkeley Enrollment Freeze,2022-03-03,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) issued the following statement in response to today’s California Supreme Court ruling:
I am deeply disappointed by today’s ruling by the California Supreme Court, which will reduce and then freeze UC Berkeley’s enrollment at 2020-2021 levels and prevent thousands of students from being offered in-person admission to the University of California, Berkeley, this fall.
My thoughts today are with the thousands of students and their families who will receive devastating news after working to earn their spot at UC Berkeley. In particular, I want to note that these cuts include slots for transfer students, who have spent years studying at California’s community colleges to pursue their higher education dreams.
Our public institutions of higher learning are the pride of California, and we must continue to grow these institutions so that all qualified Californian students have the opportunity to study at the world’s finest system of higher education. The UC system has played a critical role in making California the powerhouse that it is today. UC Berkeley in particular has shaped the world, our state, and most of all the City of Berkeley, for the better.
We must not let a group of Berkeley residents abuse CEQA for their anti-growth ideology. I am committed to working with my colleagues in the Legislature to create immediate and long term solutions. We must make this right for our students.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Resolution to Designate Portion of State Route 280 as “Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway”,2022-02-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today, Assemblymember Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced ACR 151 to designate a portion of State Route 280 in Santa Clara County as the “Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway.”
“Captain Manoukian’s heart for service and desire to leave the world in a better place than he found it represents the best our country has to offer,” Assemblymember Berman said. “To commemorate the 10th anniversary of Captain Manoukian’s ultimate sacrifice to our country, the Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian Memorial Highway honors his legacy of unwavering bravery, courageous leadership and extraordinary heroism.”
The resolution, introduced on Captain Manoukian’s birthday, would name the portion of State Route 280 in the Town of Los Altos Hills between postmarker 10.741 and postmarker 14.844 to honor and commemorate Captain Manoukian’s service to his community and country. Captain Manoukian grew up in Los Altos Hills with his parents, The Honorable Socrates Peter Manoukian and The Honorable Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian, and two younger brothers, Michael and Martin. His paternal grandfather was a survivor of the Armenian genocide and started a new life in the United States, making sure Matthew understood the costs of unchecked oppression.
“Our dearly beloved son, Captain Matthew Patrick Manoukian, loved his family and friends, loved his Marines, loved his country, and loved serving in the United States Marine Corps — bringing hope, freedom and peace to the world. Matthew gave his life for all he loved,” said his mother, Patricia Bamattre-Manoukian. “Matthew will never be forgotten, and I know that his ‘sacrifice will live on forever in the hearts of all who cherish freedom.’”
At 7-years-old, Manoukian determined he would one day serve those in need by enlisting in the United States Marine Corps, and he never waivered from his childhood dream. In January of 2006, Manoukian entered the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, VA, and later went on to graduate from Marine Special Operations Command among the top tier of Marines who entered the program.
“Matt was a natural leader who knew how to bring people from all walks of life together,” said his brother, Dr. Martin Manoukian. “He expected nothing but the best of himself, brought out the best in others, and elevated the performance of everyone around him.”
Captain Manoukian served two deployments to Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan. While preparing for his first tour of duty in Iraq, Manoukian voraciously studied the cultures of the Middle East and learned to speak Arabic. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, Manoukian led efforts focused on bringing stability and security to the respective regions—working with local leaders to establish judicial systems and police forces and unifying local village leadership with district level governance.
""Captain Matt led from the front and led by example,” said his father, Socrates Peter Manoukian. “He never ordered his Marines to do anything that he would not do and did not do himself. He made every Marine feel important to the success of the mission and earned their respect and trust.”
On August 10, 2012, the Marine Tactical Operations Center where Captain Manoukian was working came under automatic small arms fire from a rogue Afghan uniformed policeman attacking from inside the perimeter. In the face of a near certain death, Captain Manoukian drew his pistol and engaged the attacker while commanding his Marines to maneuver to safety. Captain Manoukian courageously drew heavy fire upon himself and engaged the enemy until he fell mortally wounded from the shooter's overwhelming fire. Captain Manoukian’s bold and decisive actions assisted in halting the gunman's assault and forcing him to withdraw, enabling his Marines to survive.
In 2014, Captain Manoukian, who was affectionately referred to by the locals as Captain Haidar (meaning “Lion”), was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the Marine Corps’ second-highest award for bravery, for his heroic and selfless actions of exposing himself to enemy fire, thereby allowing his comrades to escape and saving their lives.
Senator Josh Becker (D-San Mateo) is a co-author of ACR 151.
Assemblymember Marc Berman represents the 24th Assembly District, which includes southern San Mateo County and northern Santa Clara County in the heart of the Silicon Valley.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Boost Affordable Housing Supply,2022-02-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) announced that he has introduced two bills, AB 2006 and AB 2063, focused on addressing barriers to the production of affordable housing. These bills support the state’s goals to provide more affordable housing opportunities for Californians. 
“California has a dire shortage of affordable housing,” said Assemblymember Berman. “These two common-sense bills will remove barriers that delay critically needed affordable housing production. The limited resources of our local affordable housing providers should be spent housing our most vulnerable neighbors, not filing unnecessarily duplicative paperwork with multiple state agencies or being spent on fees that prevent affordable housing from being built.”
AB 2006 would sreamline the state’s affordable housing compliance process, modernizing an unnecessarily burdensome bureaucratic process. The Legislature has been working for years to accelerate production and increase the efficiency of the affordable housing finance system. Housing providers today are required to report to up to three different state agencies—often at the same time, usually in different formats—on everything from the physical state of their units to their operating budgets. AB 2006, sponsored by the California Housing Consortium and the California Housing Partnership, will finally simplify this process, directing the state to identify one entity responsible for compliance monitoring.
“This common-sense legislation will make the work of the state and affordable housing providers easier and more efficient, while helping focus resources where they should be: On providing safe, affordable housing for our residents,” said Ray Pearl, Executive Director of the California Housing Consortium.
“By streamlining the oversight currently handled by multiple state housing agencies, this smart bill will make it less expensive and time-consuming for the state’s private sector partners to provide affordable homes for those in need,” said Matt Schwartz, President and CEO of the California Housing Partnership.
AB 2063 will address another barrier to affordable housing production and strengthen the state’s longstanding density bonus law by prohibiting cities from imposing affordable housing fees on density bonus units. The intention of the California State Density Bonus was to incentivize building more onsite affordable housing. However, tacking on additional fees undermines the intent of this law and can prevent desperately needed affordable housing from actually getting built.
“To alleviate California's housing affordability crisis it's essential to make it faster and easier to build more affordable homes,” said Todd David, Executive Director of Housing Action Coalition. “While our state density bonus program is an effective way to incentivize building more onsite affordable housing, some cities have sought to undermine it by imposing undue fees that make it financially infeasible and result in no new affordable housing being created. That’s why the Housing Action Coalition is proud to sponsor AB 2063 with Assemblymember Berman to ensure that such fees can no longer hinder the creation of affordable homes that residents so desperately need.”

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to Governor’s Budget Proposal,2022-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) has released the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s January Budget proposal: 
“As we face another year of uncertainty due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are fortunate to have an extraordinary $45.7 billion budget surplus, which will allow us to make critically important investments in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, homelessness and housing, and wildfires, drought, and climate change. 
“I am thrilled that Governor Newsom’s budget proposal doubles down on transformational higher education reforms that I authored last year. The budget proposal includes an additional $105 million to support the implementation of a common course numbering system for California Community Colleges established by my AB 1111, and $65 million to implement the historic college transfer reforms in my AB 928 from last year. 
“As chair of the Assembly Business and Professions Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Newsom Administration to support cannabis tax reform, which is critical for bolstering the legal marketplace, and to addressing operational challenges facing the Medical Board of California, which will strengthen consumer protections for Californians.
“Lastly, I am pleased that Governor Newsom has proposed an additional $2 million dollars in ongoing funding for the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center to expand its research and programming. This builds upon my AB 521 in 2019, which tasked the Center with developing the first-in-the-nation firearm violence prevention training for physicians.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws",2021-12-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – In 2021 Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) authored ten new laws, including making California a permanent vote-by-mail state, improving the process for community college students to transfer to a California State University or University of California campus, phasing out the sale of new gas-powered landscape equipment, and making it easier for Californians to cancel their subscriptions online. 
Elections
Assembly Bill 37 makes California a permanent vote-by-mail state beginning January 1, 2022. In addition to mailing every active registered voter a ballot, AB 37 also makes permanent the requirement that counties give every voter the opportunity to track their ballot as it moves through the mail system and as elections officials process it. Finally, the bill incorporates the following accommodations to facilitate voting by mail: allows counties to begin processing returned vote-by-mail ballots earlier; and extends the deadline for receipt of vote-by-mail ballots so voters are not disenfranchised by potential Postal Service delays. In addition, AB 37 sets minimum vote-by-mail ballot drop-off location requirements to ensure that voters have convenient options for returning their ballots.
Assembly Bill 796 improves the California New Motor Voter program to ensure its continued success registering eligible Californians to vote. The bill updates the timeline by which the Department of Motor Vehicles must process voter registrations and track, monitor, and report processing data. Additionally, the Secretary of State must appoint a taskforce to monitor implementation and report on the effectiveness of the program.
Higher Education
Assembly Bill 928, the Student Transfer Achievement Reform (STAR) Act of 2021, transforms the college transfer process from the student perspective to ensure more community college students successfully transfer to a four-year university. These reforms include removing barriers to the successful but underutilized Associate Degree for Transfer and implementing a single lower division general education pathway that meets transfer admission to both the California State University and University of California systems.
Assembly Bill 1111 requires the California Community Colleges to adopt a common course numbering system so that comparable community college classes have the same course number. Additionally, $10 million in the state budget supports the creation of this new numbering system, which will reduce confusion and make it easier for students to transfer to a four-year university.
Environment
Assembly Bill 1346 phases out the sale of highly polluting small gas-powered engines such as leaf blowers and lawn mowers beginning in 2024. Assemblymember Berman secured $30 million in state funding to ease the transition to zero emission equipment for small landscaping businesses.
Assembly Bill 1010 requires licensed architects to study zero net carbon design so future buildings are greener. Architects must complete five hours of continuing education training on zero net carbon design every two-year licensing period beginning January 1, 2023.
Assembly Bill 1219 reauthorizes the Natural Heritage Preservation Tax Credit program. Beginning January 1, 2022, the state, local governments, and qualified non-profits may acquire conservation, park, or habitat land at a reduced cost by offering the landowner a state tax credit. Under this program, a willing landowner may choose to donate land to a state, local government, or non-profit organization, and upon approval by the Wildlife Conservation Board, receive a 55 percent tax credit against their state personal or corporate income tax.
Online Subscription Cancellation 
Assembly Bill 390 makes it easier for Californians to cancel their subscriptions online without having to jump through hoops and ensures that consumers are better informed about when and how much they will be charged for their subscriptions. California will become the first state to require businesses to notify consumers before free trials and promotional offers lasting longer than 31 days expire. Businesses will also have to notify customers before their annual subscriptions automatically renew, joining only a handful of states that require these renewal reminders.
Health
Assembly Bill 541 addresses disproportionately high smoking rates among people in treatment for addiction. Beginning January 1, 2022, treatment programs will be required to assess patients for tobacco use and offer or refer them to treatment to quit tobacco.
Victim Protection
Assembly Bill 1143 protects victims of harassment from arbitrary legal barriers that have prevented Californians from securing legal protection from their harasser. Beginning January 1, 2022, the courts may authorize alternative means of service of a petition for a civil harassment restraining order if the victim of harassment is unable to serve the respondent personally.
Budget Accomplishments:
After several years of advocating for community college students' basic needs such as housing, food, and mental health services, Assemblymember Berman secured $30 million in annual state funding for every community college campus to establish a basic needs center and hire a basic needs coordinator.
Assemblymember Berman also secured funding and language in the 2021-22 State Budget to create an Office of School-Based Health Programs within the California Department of Education. The new office will be operational by January 1, 2022, and support schools in providing greater access to health care services on campus, while schools draw down more federal dollars.

Marc Berman,California Becomes First State in the Nation to Phase Out Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers,2021-10-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom has signed landmark legislation to phase out the sale of new gas-powered small off-road engines (SORE) in California. The new law, which affects gas-powered leaf blowers and lawn mowers, was introduced by Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) in response to projections that smog-forming pollution from SORE will surpass that from passenger cars this year. Berman and Gonzalez secured $30 million in the state’s budget to create a statewide incentive program to help landscaping businesses transition to zero-emission equipment.
“By signing AB 1346, Governor Newsom has made good on his commitment to a clean energy future that protects the health of all Californians—including workers who face disproportionate health risks from air pollution,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Coupled with $30 million in zero-emission incentives, we are ensuring an equitable transition to clean technology. I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing this landmark legislation to protect people and our planet.”
“Small gas engines are not only bad for our environment and contributing to our climate crisis, they can cause asthma and other health issues for workers who use them,” said Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez. “It’s time we phased out these super polluters, and help small landscaping businesses transition to cleaner alternatives.”
AB 1346 would require the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to set emissions requirements for small off-road engines to zero by 2024 or whenever CARB determines is feasible. Small off-road engines emit high levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), reactive organic gases (ROG), and particulate matter (PM), which adversely impact human health, causing lung cancer, heart disease, strokes, asthma, and other respiratory ailments. A 2018 study by the California Air Resources Board found that operators of gas-powered devices could potentially double their current cancer risk from volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
What Others Are Saying:
“AB 1346 will protect Californians’ health by cleaning up the shockingly high pollution from small off-road engines like leaf blowers and lawn mowers,” said Bill Magavern, policy director of the Coalition for Clean Air. “We thank Assemblymembers Berman and Gonzalez and the many co-authors, as well as Governor Newsom, for putting public health first.”
“Californians face the most difficult air pollution challenges in the United States, and small off-road engines are a growing source of this health burden,” said Will Barrett, senior director of clean air advocacy with the American Lung Association. “By signing AB 1346 into law, Governor Newsom is accelerating a zero-emissions pathway to healthier air and healthier lungs.”
“AB 1346 recognizes that California must address the significant air pollution created by gas-powered equipment and off-road engines,” said Erin Rodriguez with Union of Concerned Scientists. “This bill will help achieve the emissions reductions needed to improve our air quality and meet our state’s climate goals.”
“AB 1346 will curb toxic pollution in California neighborhoods by addressing emissions from leaf blowers, lawn mowers and other small off-road engines,” said Daniel Barad, policy advocate with Sierra Club California. “This bill is another important step towards breathable air and a livable climate in California.”

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Historic Legislation to Transform College Transfer Process,2021-10-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – At a signing ceremony at California State University, Northridge earlier today, Governor Gavin Newsom signed historic legislation easing the path for community college students to transfer to a four-year university. Assembly Bills 928 and 1111, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), address unnecessary barriers within the transfer process and require greater collaboration between California’s higher education systems.
“Over the last five years I’ve held hearings across California to discuss higher education issues,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. “When students discussed their experience with the transfer process from community college to four-year university their message was loud and clear: transfer is too complex, confusing, and difficult to navigate. Instead of being a clear path, it’s a maze, and it’s costing students time and money that they can’t afford. Together AB 928 and 1111 will make it easier for students to achieve their educational goals. I am grateful that Governor Newsom signed these historic bills, and for the advocates and students who inspired these reforms.”
AB 928 transforms the transfer process from the student perspective, removing barriers to the successful but underutilized Associate Degree for Transfer and establishing a single general education pathway that meets transfer admission to both CSU and UC. AB 1111 removes another transfer barrier by requiring comparable community college classes to have the same course number through a common course numbering system, reducing student confusion.
What Others Are Saying:
“We’re turning commitments into reality by ensuring that our students have more access to high-quality educational opportunities, creating a change of course for generations to come and bolstering California’s innovation economy. Californians have thrived at our world class universities for decades, but not everyone has had similar access – today that’s changing. Everyone deserves a shot at the ‘California Dream’ – we’re eliminating equity gaps and increasing opportunities at our universities to make those dreams a reality for more California students.” – Governor Gavin Newsom
“California continues to lead the way in creating an equitable path to a bachelor’s degree for millions of students across the state. AB 928 builds on the work I envisioned ten years ago, working with the Campaign for College Opportunity, students, civil rights and business leaders in creating the Associate Degree for Transfer to help support and streamline the process for community college students to transfer to a university. I applaud Assemblymember Berman, the California state legislature and Governor Newsom for continuing this critical work to ensure our students are prepared for success and ready to meet future workforce needs.” – U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.)
“For the millions of community college students in California who dream of attending a university, today’s action ensures that dreams can become a reality. Fixing transfer is one of the most significant ways to improve student success, close racial equity gaps in higher education, and ensure our state can meet future workforce needs. We thank Governor Newsom for his commitment to strengthening higher education in California and commend the unwavering leadership of higher education and student champion Assemblymember Marc Berman, Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis, and the Legislature for fixing transfer so that more community colleges have a clear path into our universities.” – Michele Siqueiros, president of the Campaign for College Opportunity. 
About AB 928 and AB 1111:
Only 19 percent of students with a transfer goal successfully transfer within four years, and only 28 percent transfer within six years. AB 928 addresses these unacceptable, yet persistent community college transfer rates by increasing coordination between California’s public colleges and universities and eliminating unnecessary hurdles that keep students from transferring.
Specifically, AB 928 establishes a committee to provide coordination between California’s higher education systems to significantly increase transfer and close racial equity gaps, requires the creation of a single lower division general education pathway that meets transfer admission requirements to both CSU and UC, and ensures every community college student wanting to transfer is placed on the Associate Degree for Transfer pathway.
AB 1111 requires all California Community Colleges to adopt a common course numbering system for all general education requirement courses and transfer pathway courses. The State Budget includes $10 million to fund the creation of a common course numbering system.
Both bills passed out of the Legislature with unanimous support. AB 928 is co-sponsored by the Campaign for College Opportunity, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, the Cal State Student Association, and the University of California Student Association. AB 1111 is co-sponsored by the Campaign for College Opportunity, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, and the Student Senate for California Community Colleges.

Marc Berman,California Makes It Easier to Cancel Online Subscriptions,2021-10-04,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation ensuring Californians can cancel subscriptions online, at will, and without having to jump through hoops. Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), the new law also requires businesses to notify consumers before lengthy free trials and promotions end and before year-long subscriptions automatically renew.
“Canceling a subscription online should be as easy as signing up online,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Yet millions of Californians are subjected to lengthy, confusing, and inconvenient cancellation processes designed to make you give up and keep paying. This change in law enables Californians to cancel unwanted subscriptions online easily and creates the first-in-the-nation requirement for businesses to notify consumers before lengthy free trials and promotions expire. I am thrilled Governor Newsom has signed AB 390 so Californians can cancel unwanted subscriptions without hassle and are better informed about when and how much they will be charged.”
After surveying 5,000 Americans in 2018, McKinsey & Company found that nearly 35% of consumers had three or more subscriptions. That same year, West Monroe, a national business consulting firm, found after surveying 2,500 American’s budgets that the respondents spent $237 per month on subscriptions and 84% underestimated how much they spend on subscriptions monthly.
Assembly Bill 390 establishes critical consumer protections for Californians as the subscription market continues to grow rapidly. In accordance with the new law, businesses that allow consumers to sign-up for subscriptions online must also permit consumers to cancel those subscriptions online, at will, and without engaging any further steps that obstruct or delay their ability to cancel immediately such as talking to a customer representative or completing a lengthy survey. In addition, businesses must notify consumers before free trials and promotions lasting longer than 31 days expire and before annual subscriptions automatically renew. The new law takes effect July 1, 2022.
California is the first state in the country to require reminder notices for free trials and promotions, and only the 9th state to require notice reminders for annual subscriptions.
Assembly Bill 390 received bipartisan support in the Legislature and was supported by the California Low-Income Consumer Coalition, Consumer Action, Consumer Attorneys, and various district attorneys.

Marc Berman,California to Continue Mailing Voters Ballots Before Every Election,2021-09-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA — Assembly Bill 37, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom today, making permanent several election reforms that were adopted and used for the November 2020 General Election, including automatically mailing every active registered voter a ballot and giving every voter the opportunity to track their ballot to ensure it is counted. AB 37 additionally would set minimum vote-by-mail ballot drop-off location requirements, ensuring that voters have convenient options for returning their ballots.
“As states across our country continue to enact undemocratic voter suppression laws, California is increasing voter access, expanding voting options and bolstering elections integrity and transparency,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “Last year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election. I extend my thanks to Assembly Elections Chair Assemblymember Marc Berman for his leadership on this issue.”
""When voters get a ballot in the mail, they vote,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, Chair of the Assembly Elections Committee. “We saw this in the 2020 General Election when, in the middle of a global health pandemic, we had the highest voter turnout in California since Harry Truman was president. I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing AB 37, ensuring that every active registered voter in California will receive a ballot in the mail before every future election. As other states actively look for ways to make it harder for people to vote, California is expanding access to an already safe and secure ballot.""
In April 2020, Assemblymember Berman amended his AB 860 to require that every active registered California voter receive a vote-by-mail ballot for the 2020 General Election. AB 860 also allowed counties to begin processing returned vote-by-mail ballots earlier, extended the deadline for receipt of vote-by-mail ballots, allowed voters to use remote accessible vote-by-mail systems, and ensured that all California voters had the ability to track their ballots as they moved through the mail system and were processed by elections officials (a system that was initially created by Berman’s AB 2218 in 2018). The bill was signed into law as an urgency measure in June 2020, and was a key part of the state’s preparations for conducting a safe and successful presidential election during the COVID-19 pandemic. In all, approximately 15 million Californians voted in the General Election using a ballot that was mailed to them, and more than 5 million Californians registered for ballot tracking.
These reforms were extended through the end of 2021 by Senate Bill 29 (Umberg).
California is now the sixth state to require active registered voters to be mailed a ballot before each election. Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Utah already do so.

Marc Berman,Elections Chairs Call for Reform of Flawed Recall System,2021-09-15,press_release,NA,"Sacramento – The California Legislature’s two leading members on election issues on Wednesday announced a coordinated effort to examine reforms to California’s recall election system.
Assemblymember Marc Berman (D – Menlo Park) and Senator Steve Glazer (D – Contra Costa) said they are determined to fix a broken system in the wake of the 2021 gubernatorial recall election, which raised questions about whether a system designed in the early 20th century has enough checks and balances to ensure democratic and fair elections.
Berman, Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Elections, and Glazer, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments, will hold a series of bipartisan joint hearings in the coming months to begin a statewide discussion regarding potential improvements to California’s recall laws. The intent is to produce a proposal that will be taken up in the Legislature during the 2022 legislative session.
“Now that the recall is over, I believe it is time to re-evaluate and update California’s recall process,” said Senator Glazer. “The voters want to see a more democratic process put in place that keeps elected officials accountable, but prevents political gamesmanship of the rules. We hope to work with policy experts and stakeholders of different political perspectives on a viable solution that ultimately makes sense for a modern-day California.”
The committees will evaluate recall laws in other states, and will invite experts to examine California’s recall process, including issues such as grounds for removal; signature gathering requirements; process of succession if a governor is recalled; and other issues. The process will be open to the public in an effort to maintain the utmost transparency, and the committees also hope to include the expertise of elections officials, political scientists, legal experts, and others.
“While the recall is an important tool for voters to address misconduct or corruption by elected officials, yesterday’s election highlighted the fundamentally undemocratic nature of California’s existing recall process,” said Assemblymember Berman. “California law should not allow someone else to be recalled and replaced by a candidate who receives far fewer votes. I look forward to hearing from a bipartisan group of experts about how California’s recall process should be reformed.”
Senate President pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins said that she supports examining recall reform.
“A thorough review of California's recall law is timely and worthy of debate, and I would like to thank Senator Glazer and Assemblymember Berman for spearheading the efforts to start this important conversation,” Atkins said.
Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said, “It is totally appropriate to begin discussion of reforming the recall process. We came far too close to having a Governor elected by a tiny fraction of eligible voters. While that is no way to pick the leader of the most populous state in the nation, it would be equally wrong to make any changes without a thorough study of alternatives. I look forward to hearing the discussion.""
The recall process was adopted in California almost 110 years ago, but has been used sparingly for most of the state’s history. More than 70% of the attempts to recall elected state officials that have qualified for the ballot, including the only two statewide recall elections in California history, have occurred in the last 27 years. Each of California’s last nine Governors has faced multiple recall attempts, though only two of those attempts have qualified for the ballot.
Two recent polls, conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California and by the Institute of Government Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, have found that a majority of voters favor keeping but reforming the recall process.

Marc Berman,Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis and Educational Leaders Laud Legislation to Transform College Transfer Process,2021-09-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – The Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act of 2021, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, passed out of the Legislature today and now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature. If signed, AB 928 will improve the process for community college students to transfer to a four-year university.
“The troubling reality is that the status quo is failing our students,” said Assemblymember Berman. “As Chair of the Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education, I have heard directly from students who say the transfer process is too complex, confusing, and difficult to navigate. Too many community college students hoping to find an affordable and achievable pathway to a four-year university instead are confronted with a maze of pathways and requirements that create confusion, lead to unnecessary unit accumulation, and too often lead to students dropping out before obtaining a degree. AB 928 is responsive to these students and will help ensure more Californians can accomplish their educational goals.”
What Others Are Saying
“As Lieutenant Governor and the only person to serve on all three governing boards of California’s public higher education institutions, I commend the Legislature for approving AB 928 – a critical step in ensuring that our transfer system is truly serving California students. This bill will improve our transfer system by charting a clear path for community college students to transfer to a four-year college, saving studunts time and money.” – Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis
“The establishment of one streamlined lower division general education (GE) pathway for students from all backgrounds to transfer from community colleges to either the CSU or the UC is a game-changer and will ease their path towards a four-year degree.” – Dr. Joseph I. Castro, chancellor of the California State University
“AB 928 is a student-centered effort to address the tragically low transfer rates for community college students in California. This historic bill tackles a problematic transfer maze that has harmed student success and exacerbated racial inequities at our community colleges for far too long. We must embrace timely solutions like AB 928 that ensure all California students have a clear, bureaucracy-free pathway to earn their degrees and transfer to our universities. Our students know, and our State legislators have recognized, that creating a seamless transfer path is the right thing to do and is key to providing an equitable opportunity to succeed for community college students.” – Michele Siqueiros, president of the Campaign for College Opportunity
“As a transfer student, I faced a maze of confusing transfer pathways that caused many students, like myself, to get lost. This bill would fix many inequities in the system and change the lives of hopeful transfer students all across the state of California.” – Alexis Atsilvsgi Zaragoza, student regent of the UC Board of Regents and former student board member of the California Community Colleges Board of Governors
Transfer from California’s community colleges to its public and private nonprofit universities is central to the state’s Master Plan for Higher Education, the 1960’s educational blueprint that Assemblymember Berman set out to review in 2017. Since convening a series of hearings throughout the state as chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, Assemblymember Berman has been committed to reimagining the transfer process from a student perspective.
Only 19 percent of students with a transfer goal successfully transfer within four years, and only 28 percent transfer within six years. AB 928 is comprehensive, student-centered legislation that would streamline and improve the transfer process, making it easier for California students to accomplish their educational goals. As California begins to recover from the pandemic, now more than ever, it is critical to increase degree attainment, improve time to degree, and close racial equity gaps.
AB 928 would establish an Intersegmental Implementation Committee to provide a venue to facilitate intersegmental coordination and greater state-level accountability for implementation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT), and to focus on improving transfer outcomes for all students. The bill also requires the Intersegmental Committee of Academic Senates to establish a singular lower division general education pathway that meets admission requirements for both the CSU and UC. Going from two general education pathways to one makes it easier for students to apply to both CSU and UC and keeps their options open. The bill requires community colleges to place students on an ADT pathway, only if students declare a goal of transfer and such a pathway exists for their intended major. Importantly, students can opt-out and are empowered to choose what is best for them and their educational goals.
AB 928 passed out of the Assembly with a 77-0 vote and has received unanimous support throughout the legislative process. AB 928 is co-sponsored by the Campaign for College Opportunity, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, Cal State Student Association, and University of California Student Association.

Marc Berman,Bill to Phase Out Gas-Powered Landscaping Equipment Passes Legislature,2021-09-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Legislature passed AB 1346, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego), which will phase out the sale of new gas-powered small off-road engines in California. Small off-road engines, primarily found in outdoor power equipment, emit smog-forming pollutants at levels projected to outpace those from passenger cars this year.
“Leaf blowers, lawn mowers, and other equipment with small gas-powered engines emit staggering levels of air pollution,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “These noisy machines are terribly disruptive to communities across California, and the workers who breathe in exhaust from this equipment day in and day out face disproportionate health risks, including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. To ensure an equitable transition to safer, cleaner equipment, we secured $30 million in the state budget to help small businesses purchase zero-emission replacements.”
AB 1346 would require the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to set emissions requirements for small off-road engines to zero by 2024 or whenever CARB determines is feasible. Small off-road engines emit high levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), reactive organic gases (ROG), and particulate matter (PM), which adversely affect air quality and human health. By 2031, NOx and ROG emissions from SORE are projected to be twice those from passenger cars in California.
What Others Are Saying
""Small gas engines are not only bad for our environment and contributing to our climate crisis, they can cause asthma and other health issues for workers who use them,” said Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego). “It’s time we phased out these super polluters, and help small landscaping businesses transition to cleaner alternatives.""
“AB 1346 will protect Californians’ health by cleaning up the shockingly high pollution from small off-road engines like leaf blowers and lawn mowers,” said Bill Magavern, Policy Director of Coalition for Clean Air. “We thank Assemblymembers Berman and Gonzalez and the many co-authors, and we call on Governor Newsom to sign the bill into law.”
“Californians face the most difficult air pollution challenges in the United States, and small off-road engines are a growing source of this health burden,” said Will Barrett, Senior Director of Clean Air Advocacy with the American Lung Association. “Governor Newsom should sign AB 1346 to accelerate the pathway to healthier air and healthier lungs.”
“AB 1346 recognizes that California must address the significant air pollution created by gas-powered equipment and off-road engines,” said Erin Rodriguez, Policy Advocate with Union of Concerned Scientists. “This bill will help achieve the emissions reductions needed to improve our air quality and meet our state’s climate goals. We urge Governor Newsom to sign AB 1346 into law.”
“AB 1346 will curb toxic pollution in California neighborhoods by addressing emissions from leaf blowers, lawn mowers and other small off-road engines,” said Daniel Barad, Policy Advocate with Sierra Club California. “This bill is another important step towards breathable air and a livable climate in California. We urge Governor Newsom to sign this health protective legislation.""

Marc Berman,Legislature Votes to Make Recent Election Reforms Permanent,2021-09-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assembly Bill 37, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), cleared its final hurdle in the state Legislature today passing out of the Assembly on a 60-17 vote. The bill will make permanent several election reforms that were adopted and used for the November 2020 General Election, including automatically mailing every active registered voter a ballot and giving every voter the opportunity to track their ballot to ensure it is counted. AB 37 additionally would set minimum vote-by-mail ballot drop-off location requirements, ensuring that voters have convenient options for returning their ballots.
“When voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, chair of the Assembly Elections Committee. “Last year we enacted critical emergency election reforms to protect the health and safety of voters and poll workers, and they worked tremendously well. We had the highest voter turnout in 70 years, and elections officials across California commented on how smoothly the process went. Now that we know this system works, let’s make these meaningful reforms permanent to make it easier for Californians to vote in future elections.”
In April 2020, Assemblymember Berman amended his Assembly Bill 860 to require that every active registered California voter receive a vote-by-mail ballot for the 2020 General Election. AB 860 also allowed counties to begin processing returned vote-by-mail ballots earlier, extended the deadline for receipt of vote-by-mail ballots, allowed voters to use remote accessible vote-by-mail systems, and ensured that all California voters had the ability to track their ballots as they moved through the mail system and were processed by elections officials (a system that was initially created by Berman’s AB 2218 in 2018).

Marc Berman,Governor Newsom Signs Bill to Integrate Tobacco Treatment in Substance Use Disorder Programs,2021-09-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Newsom has signed AB 541, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), which will help patients in drug treatment programs quit smoking.
In 2019, Dr. Chwen-Yuen Angie Chen from Stanford School of Medicine attended a community coffee hosted by Assemblymember Berman and voiced concerns about disproportionately high smoking rates among Californians in drug treatment programs.
“I was surprised to learn that people with substance use disorders are more likely to die from tobacco-related illness than from the addiction that brings them to treatment in the first place,” said Assemblymember Berman. “When patients enter drug treatment, they should be provided with the tools to quit all substances, not become addicted to a new one.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), individuals with behavioral or substance use disorders are more than twice as likely to smoke cigarettes as those without such disorders. Research shows that quitting tobacco supports behavioral health treatment, could make relapse less likely, and has immediate physical health benefits. The CDC recommends the integration of tobacco treatment into behavioral healthcare, but California’s drug treatment programs rank among the lowest in the United States as it relates to screening for tobacco and providing a pathway for patients to quit smoking.
“We are grateful to Assemblymember Berman for crafting a bill that provides much needed screening and treatment for a substance use disorder that causes more health consequences than any other substance: tobacco smoking,” said Dr. Chwen-Yuen Angie Chen, on behalf of California Society of Addiction Medicine. “Thank you also to the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals who contributed significantly to this work. We applaud the effort behind passing AB 541 and Governor Newsom’s signature.”
AB 541 requires all substance use disorder programs in California to assess patients for tobacco use, inform them about how continued smoking could affect their recovery, and offer or refer them to treatment to quit smoking.
“We are extremely excited that Governor Newsom has recognized the importance of smoking cessation by signing AB 541,” said Pete Nielsen, President and CEO of the California Consortium of Addiction Programs and Professionals.
AB 541 will improve recovery outcomes and reduce tobacco-related illness among a vulnerable population in California.

Marc Berman,Berman Releases Statement on Support for SB 9 and 10,2021-08-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Assemblymember Berman released the following statement in support of SB 9 and 10: 
""Every day, tens of thousands of my constituents – and millions of Californians – struggle under the weight of the housing crisis. Due to the astronomical cost of housing in my district and throughout California, they are forced to choose between paying rent and utilities, buying food, or accessing the healthcare they need. We are failing these friends and neighbors.
""For decades we have been prolific at creating jobs, but have been negligent when it comes to building the housing necessary to accommodate so many more workers. Addressing the housing crisis will require multiple solutions - there is no silver bullet. One such solution is SB 10, a completely permissive bill that provides cities with another tool to try to build denser, infill housing. For as long as I've been in the Assembly, the cities in my district have requested additional, voluntary tools to build more housing. That is exactly what SB 10 does, which is why I supported it.
""Another solution is SB 9, which will allow up to four units of housing to be built on a single-family lot – an increase of one unit compared to existing law. The author of the bill, President pro tem Toni Atkins, has made multiple amendments to address concerns that were raised by opponents, some as recently as last week. These amendments include adding anti-displacement provisions to make sure renters aren’t kicked out, adding a three-year homeowner occupancy requirement to make sure the bill benefits homeowners, not institutional investors, and authorizing local governments to deny a proposed housing development or lot split if the building official makes a written finding that it would create a specific fire hazard that cannot be mitigated.
""I was struck by the range of colleagues who spoke in favor of SB 9 on the Assembly Floor this morning, and the diversity of the districts they represent. They were urban, suburban, and rural, Democrat and Republican, from very liberal to very conservative, and white, Black, Latino, and API. The one thing they all have in common is they see the dire impacts that the housing crisis is having on their communities, and they refuse to continue kicking the can down the road. I agree with them.
""SB 9 won’t single handedly solve our housing crisis, but it will help address housing affordability by creating duplexes and smaller single-family homes at more moderate price points. This is in addition to the historic investments the state is making to support local governments and non-profits in developing affordable housing.
""For decades we have failed to build enough housing in California, and we have failed the most vulnerable among us. These two housing bills attempt to right those wrongs and create a framework to restore some of the socio-economic diversity that my district – one of the most expensive in the country – has lost. That is why I voted yes on SB 9 and SB 10.""

Marc Berman,California Funds Basic Needs Centers to Address Food and Housing Insecurity,2021-07-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 132, which provides a coordinated and integrated approach to meet college students’ basic needs. This postsecondary education trailer bill is based on legislation (Assembly Bill 775) by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and implements a $30 million ongoing investment in the Budget Act of 2021 to support basic needs centers.
“California community college students are experiencing hunger and homelessness at alarming rates, which is why I introduced legislation this year to require a basic needs center and coordinator on every campus,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education. “After years of advocating for students’ basic needs, I am proud to have secured significant and ongoing funding to address this crisis. This is long overdue and will help our most vulnerable students succeed and thrive in college.”
AB 132 requires each community college campus to establish a basic needs center and hire a basic needs coordinator by July 1, 2022. The center and coordinator will provide a single point of contact for students to access basic needs services, such as CalFresh and other programs. The basic needs coordinator will act as a broker in linking students to on- and off-campus housing, food, mental health, and other basic needs services and resources.
What advocates are saying:
Debbie Raucher, John Burton Advocates for Youth, Director of Education: “To close the achievement gaps between student subpopulations, the state needs to embrace a holistic approach to student success. This cannot ignore the reality that until all students have ongoing and consistent access to food to eat and a place to live, educational equity goals will never be realized. As California moves towards recovery, this groundbreaking investment will ensure that students across the state, and in particular those who have lost ground as a result of the pandemic, can access the resources that they need to be successful. We are extremely grateful to Assemblymember Berman for his advocacy and commitment to this issue.”
Mahmoud Zahriya, Young Invincibles, West Advocacy Manager: “Today, the Governor signed landmark legislation that will improve the education experience for low-income college students across the state. When students lack the basic resources they need like food or housing assistance, they are unable to prioritize academic progress. At Young Invincibles, we understand racial equity is a necessary and integral part of overall advancements in higher education. Thanks to efforts championed by Assemblymember Marc Berman, students will no longer have to skip meals or basic necessities over tuition-related costs.”
Jasmine Prasad, Student Senate for California Community Colleges, Vice President of Legislative Affairs: “As a student leader, I have heard and witnessed first-hand, students struggling with basic needs across the state. The Legislature has recognized and responded to the students' desperate need for equity reform. The basic needs centers and coordinators will allow more resources to empower students’ success in higher education.”
Brandon Zuniga, Los Angeles Trade Technical College student: “As a former unhoused student who sometimes lived in the Blue Line metro station, the levels of distress, and hunger I have endured left a long lasting impact on my life and in my educational pursuits. The funds that will be allocated for basic needs centers will influence the lives of countless students and positively impact their educational outcomes. I am proud to see Governor Newsom stepping up to help young adults like me and building structures that will provide the support systems we need to be successful in college. I am proud that many students across the state are going to get the help and resources they desperately need.”

Marc Berman,Berman Applauds District Funding in State Budget,2021-06-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) supported a number of budget bills that highlight the historic nature of the 2021-22 State Budget. In addition to the billions of dollars in critical funding to aid California’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the budget included funding to establish a statewide Office of School-Based Health, a concept that Assemblymember Berman has championed since 2019, and to support community projects in the 24th Assembly District.
“Today, we strengthened our commitment to California’s recovery by extending the eviction moratorium, expanding rent relief, and approving new stimulus checks to millions of Californians,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman.
“I am also thrilled that we approved funding to establish an Office of School-Based Health within the California Department of Education. I have long advocated for the creation of this office to help K-12 schools take advantage of available federal funds to meet the growing demand for student health and mental health services in our schools. As students and families recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, this office could not be timelier. 
“I am also excited to have secured millions of dollars to support the Carter Park Renovation Project in Half Moon Bay and for the acquisition of the Cloverdale Ranch property in San Mateo County. A renovated Carter Park will provide a beautiful gathering and performing arts space for the residents of Half Moon Bay and the Coastside. The acquisition of Cloverdale Ranch will conserve over 6,200 acres of undeveloped land in San Mateo County, an almost 10% increase to the acreage preserved by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space Trust. These projects will contribute to the vibrancy and connectivity of our communities, and preserve cherished open space for residents to enjoy for decades to come.”
$700,000 for the Office of School-Based Health
Senate Bill 129 includes $700,000 for the California Department of Education to establish an Office of School-Based Health, as advocated for by Assemblymember Berman’s Assembly Bill 563 this year and Assembly Bill 1322 in 2019. The Office of School-Based Health will ensure greater access to health care services at elementary, middle, and high school campuses, while drawing down federal funds to support the increase in services provided. 
$4.75 million for Carter Park Renovation Project in the City of Half Moon
Senate Bill 129 includes $4.75 million for the Carter Park Renovation Project in the City of Half Moon Bay. The City’s approved Parks Master Plan identified Carter Park as an underutilized, natural open space tucked away beneath the entrance to historic downtown Main Street. After extensive community outreach, targeted stakeholder groups, and review by the Parks and Recreation Commission, Planning Commission, and City Council, the proposed project includes amphitheater seating, a performing arts stage, a walking trail through the existing redwood trees along Pilarcitos Creek, a picnic area, a playground, and amenities including restrooms. When completed, Carter Park plans to host a variety of performing arts including annual Shakespeare productions, the City’s Summer’s End Music Festival, and other cultural events. 
$8 million for Cloverdale Ranch in San Mateo County
The $8 million included in Senate Bill 129 will allow the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District to purchase and preserve the Cloverdale Ranch, a regionally significant coastal property, which encompass over 6,200 acres of undeveloped lands in San Mateo County. Cloverdale Ranch, located between the town of Pescadero and the County’s southern border, is characterized by sweeping coastal vistas, coastal terrace prairies and scrub, secluded valleys, marshes and wet meadows, lakes and streams. In addition to important fish species habitat, Cloverdale Ranch has the largest intact coastal terrace prairie habitat in the county and the third largest in the state. It is also home to the federally and state endangered San Francisco garter snake. This funding enables the opportunity to establish an open space preserve, provide access to open space and resource lands that are currently inaccessible, sustain local agriculture, and protect the rural character of California’s ranchlands.
Earlier this year, Assemblymember Berman successfully advocated for $30 million ongoing to establish a basic needs center and hire a basic needs coordinator at every community college campus, as well as a one-time investment of $10 million to establish a common course numbering system for community colleges.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces New Bill to Protect Campaign Donors from Deceptive Tactics,2021-06-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) have introduced new legislation, Assembly Bill 775, to ban political candidates or committees from pre-checking the recurring donation box on their websites, and to require them to obtain affirmative consent before enrolling campaign donors in recurring contributions.
“We recently learned that hundreds of thousands of people were tricked into contributing over $122 million to Donald Trump’s campaign in 2020, and that Caitlyn Jenner is using the same tactic right now to trick her donors into giving more than they intend to,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, chair of the Assembly Elections Committee. “Assembly Bill 775 will ensure that Californians are not misled into making repeated and unintended donations. Candidates should not rely on deception and trickery to raise money to fund their campaigns.”
Pre-checked donation boxes that automatically enroll donors in reoccurring payments at the time of an initial donation–often unbeknownst to the donor—have become increasingly popular. Earlier this year, a New York Times investigation found that former President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign made extensive use of pre-checked recurring donation boxes. As the campaign’s use of those boxes increased, the campaign also saw a spike in contribution refund requests. Ultimately, the Trump campaign had to refund nearly 11% of the funds that it raised through its online platform, totaling more than $122 million. AB 775 specifically states that “passive action by the contributor, such as failing to uncheck a pre-checked box authorizing a recurring contribution, does not meet the requirement of affirmative consent.” In addition, the bill requires a candidate or committee that accepts a recurring contribution to provide a receipt for each contribution, to provide information necessary to cancel the recurring contribution, and to immediately cancel a recurring contribution upon request.
Last month the Federal Elections Commission, composed of three Democratic-aligned and three Republican commissioners, unanimously supported a recommendation that Congress outlaw the practice of using pre-checked boxes on campaign websites to automatically enroll donors in making recurring contributions.

Marc Berman,Berman Applauds State Funding for Issues He’s Long Championed,2021-06-16,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to the Legislature’s passage of the 2021-2022 State Budget:
“Today the Legislature passed a budget poised to help every Californian bounce back/recover after fifteen long months of uncertainty and hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “With the good fortune of having significant, unanticipated resources, we are able to make critical and direly needed investments in homelessness and housing, education, and small business support.
“In addition, I could not be prouder to have spearheaded two student-centered initiatives which received funding in the budget. At alarming rates, community college students are having to ask themselves, ‘Do I pay rent this month or buy textbooks for my classes? Should I take an extra shift at work to afford groceries or should I attend class?’ After several years of advocating for students’ basic needs, I am thrilled we are allocating $30 million in ongoing funds for every campus to establish a basic needs center and hire a basic needs coordinator, in addition to investing $10 million in a common course numbering system for community colleges that will save students much needed time and money whilst simultaneously making it easier to transfer and earn their degree. Student success is critical to the California Comeback and with these critically important investments, we are well on our way.”

Marc Berman,VTA Reform on Hold to Facilitate Further Community Engagement,2021-05-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement regarding his decision to press pause on Assembly Bill 1091, legislation to reform the Santa Clara County Valley Transportation Authority’s (VTA) governing board.
“Throughout the many conversations I’ve had about AB 1091, two things have become clear: there is a strong desire throughout Santa Clara County to reform VTA governance, and there are many different opinions on what those reforms should be. It is important that we get this right, which will require additional engagement with stakeholders and the public. To allow for this to happen, I have decided not to move AB 1091 until January 2022. I appreciate everyone who has followed up in the last week seeking to constructively engage on this important issue, and look forward to working together in the coming months to come up with long overdue reforms for this critical transit agency.”
Three Civil Grand Jury Reports over the last 17 years have concluded that VTA’s governance structure is a root cause of the agency’s poor performance and is in need of structural reform. According to the 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, the VTA Board suffers from a lack of experience and continuity. VTA is currently composed of an 18-member board with 12 voting members, all of whom are current elected officials in Santa Clara County. The Civil Grand Jury found that the directors often have inadequate time to devote to the policymaking and oversight duties of VTA. The Grand Jury recommended legislation to improve the governance structure of VTA, notably including appointed directors who are not currently serving as elected officials and have relevant transportation expertise. AB 1091 would establish a smaller, more experienced, and more regionally focused VTA Board that is better positioned to address the transportation needs of Santa Clara County’s two million residents. It passed out of the Assembly Local Government Committee, 7-0.

Marc Berman,Review of California’s Master Plan for Higher Education Continues with Hearing on Faculty and Staff Needs,2021-05-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), Jose Medina (D-Riverside), and Dr. Shirley Weber (D-San Diego) held the fourth hearing of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California today. Today at UC Riverside, the Select Committee met with representatives from the California Community College, CSU, and UC systems to discuss what faculty and staff need so they can better support students. 
“It’s critical for student success that our students taught by faculty that they can relate to. Yet while our student population is much more diverse than it was when the Master Plan was written 58 years ago, faculty do not reflect that increased diversity. We must do a better job to increase the diversity of our faculty ranks,” said Berman, Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. “We also heard from student services staff, from financial aid staff, and from custodial staff who demonstrate that it takes a whole ecosystem at a college or university to make sure that students reach their full potential. This further reinforced the powerful testimony we heard from students at our last hearing. I greatly value the information provided by everyone today.”
Panelists identified a number of challenges facing faculty and staff today. The chairs of the Academic Senates of each segment, in addition to Sarah Klotz from USC’s Center for Urban Education, discussed the need for more professional development in order to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse student body. The Committee also heard from union leaders representing faculty and staff who voiced concerns about funding, understaffing, and reliance on temporary faculty. In the fourth and final panel, student services staff testified to the need for coordination among the state’s higher education segments including clear pathways for transfer students.
“College faculty and staff play a tremendous role in a student’s success,” said Assemblymember Jose Media, Chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee. “To ensure that all of our students have engaging, high-quality college experiences, we need to further invest in our faculty and staff. The state needs to dedicate more resources to ensure competitive pay and benefits to recruit and retain top talent, increase the diversity of faculty and staff, and improve the ratio of full- to part-time faculty at our colleges and universities. Supporting our staff and faculty is critical to maintaining California’s world class higher education systems and meeting the needs of our students.”
In 1960, California developed a visionary plan for the future of higher education. Known as the Master Plan, the document sought to provide guidance to the state’s higher education system. However much has changed since the Master Plan was written, and California’s higher education system must respond to a host of issues never previously envisioned.
The Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education, which was established in March 2017, is conducting a thorough review of the Master Plan. Previous hearings provided an overview of the state’s higher education system, workforce needs, and students’ needs.

Marc Berman,Berman and Gonzalez Bill Will Phase Out Gas-Powered Small Engines,2021-03-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) introduced legislation to phase out the sale of new gas-powered small off-road engines (SORE), which are primarily used in lawn and garden equipment, including leaf blowers, lawn mowers, and other outdoor power equipment. AB 1346 would require new sales of SORE to be zero-emission by 2024 or whenever the California Air Resources Board (CARB) determines is feasible, whichever is later.
“Today, operating the best-selling gas-powered commercial leaf blower for one hour emits air pollutants comparable to driving a 2017 Toyota Camry from Los Angeles to Denver,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Smog-forming emissions from small engines will surpass those from passenger vehicles this year. We must look beyond transportation if we are to achieve the emissions reductions needed to fight climate change and improve air quality and health in our communities.”
SORE are engines that produce 25 horsepower or less, but emit high levels of air pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen (NOx), reactive organic gases (ROG), and particulate matter (PM), which adversely affect air quality and human health. By 2031, NOx and ROG emissions from SORE are projected to be twice those from passenger cars. AB 1346 will mitigate the negative environmental and health consequences that result from SORE.
""It’s time to phase out these super polluters. They’re not only bad for our environment, but can cause serious health issues for workers who utilize them every day,"" Assemblywoman Gonzalez (D-San Diego) said. ""We can and must help small landscaping businesses replace their gas-powered equipment with cleaner alternatives.""
AB 1346 directs CARB to develop cost-effective and technologically feasible regulations to phase out the sale of new gas-powered SORE by 2024 or whenever the board determines is feasible. The bill also requires CARB to make funding available for commercial rebates to support the transition to zero-emission SORE.
This legislation is coauthored by Majority Leader Eloise Gómez Reyes (D-San Bernardino) and Assemblymembers Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda), Christina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens), Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella), Wendy Carrillo (D-Los Angeles), Jesse Gabriel (D-Woodland Hills), Evan Low (D-Silicon Valley), Kevin Mullin (D-South San Francisco), Robert Rivas (D-Hollister), and Phil Ting (D-San Francisco).

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Introduces Legislation to Transform College Transfer Process,2021-03-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman, Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, and the Campaign for College Opportunity announced the introduction of AB 928, critical legislation to significantly increase the number of students transferring from California Community Colleges to four-year universities.
“Too many community college students hoping to find an affordable and achievable pathway to a four-year university instead are confronted with a maze of pathways and requirements that create confusion, lead to unnecessary unit accumulation, and too often lead to students dropping out before obtaining a degree. AB 928 will help streamline and improve the transfer process, making it easier for California students to accomplish their educational goals. Now more than ever, it is critical to increase degree attainment, improve time to degree, and close racial equity gaps,” said Assemblymember Berman.
Transfer from California’s community colleges to its public and private nonprofit universities is central to the state’s Master Plan for Higher Education, and as Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, Assemblymember Berman has been elevating the need to focus on reimagining the transfer process from a student-centered perspective.
AB 928, the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act of 2021, strengthens transfer by removing barriers and building upon the highly successful Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) designed to simplify the transfer pathway, save students time and money, and guarantee admission to the state’s public universities.
Through a series of conversations with students, college presidents, transfer center directors, and leaders from the University of California (UC), California State University (CSU), California Community Colleges, and Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities (AICCU), Assemblymember Berman and the Campaign for College Opportunity identified some of the most significant barriers to improving transfer and scaling the ADT. AB 928 is designed to address those barriers and strengthen a student-centered transfer pathway by:
In the last ten years, the California Community Colleges have awarded over 280,000 ADTs, but as the economy demands a more highly educated workforce and individuals are looking to earn a degree to increase their social mobility and guard against poverty and unemployment, transfer still remains elusive. Though most of the 2.2 million community college students in the state intend to transfer, fewer than half do so within six years of their initial enrollment.
“Students have faced unexpected hurdles on their path to a college education throughout this pandemic and have shown us that their talent and capacity to succeed will not be impeded. We owe it to them to ensure that the transfer system we have in place has the capacity to serve them and is intentionally designed to place them on a streamlined path to success,” said Michele Siqueiros, president of the Campaign for College Opportunity.
The ADT reduces the number of unnecessary credits students earn on their transfer journeys while driving up the increase in the number of students who transfer to the CSU with an associate’s degree. “I came into college not knowing what was necessary to transfer. My counselor at Pasadena City College introduced me to the ADT when I was a freshman, and I immediately knew this was the pathway for me. This degree allowed me to save money and time in college while also guaranteeing me admission to a CSU. Thanks to the ADT, I reached my goal of graduating and transferring in two years!” said Elizabeth Moreno, a transfer student at Cal Poly Pomona.
“The ADT has a proven track record of success and is the most valuable tool we have at our disposal to transform transfer and close racial equity gaps so that it works for far more students, especially in this difficult pandemic environment,” concluded Siqueiros.

This degree allowed me to save money and time in college while also guaranteeing me admission to a CSU. Thanks to the ADT, I reached my goal of graduating and transferring in two years!” said Elizabeth Moreno, a transfer student at Cal Poly Pomona.
“The ADT has a proven track record of success and is the most valuable tool we have at our disposal to transform transfer and close racial equity gaps so that it works for far more students, especially in this difficult pandemic environment,” concluded Siqueiros.

Marc Berman,Students tell Legislators about the Crushing Total Cost of College,2021-03-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) and Dr. Joaquin Arambula (D-Fresno) released the following statements after meeting with students and education leaders to discuss college affordability and student needs such as food, housing, and mental health care:

Assemblymembers Dr. Joaquin Arambula and Marc Berman.
“I am incredibly moved by the powerful, passionate, and very personal stories we heard from students across California. While college is meant to be intellectually challenging, far too many of today’s students are facing life challenges that reach far outside the lecture hall,” said Assemblymember Berman, who chairs the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. “The total cost of attending college - for food, housing, and health care, in addition to tuition and books - is crippling students and undermining their ability to succeed in the classroom. Many students are struggling to make ends meet, working multiple jobs and relying on food pantries to eat and friends’ couches to sleep. I’m grateful to the students we heard from yesterday, and look forward to working with them to address the issues they raised.”
Legislators met with students and education leaders at Fresno City College, in the third of five hearings being held statewide by the Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. 
“The future of California’s higher education system is critical to our region’s growth and prosperity,” said Assemblymember Dr. Joaquin Arambula (Fresno). “I am pleased that we held the committee hearing in Fresno, which will ensure that our voices are heard in Sacramento. It’s time for the Master Plan to be updated so we can adequately prepare all of our students for success.”
In 1960, California developed a visionary plan for the future of higher education. Known as the Master Plan, the document sought to provide guidance to the state’s higher education segments - California Community Colleges, the California State University, and the University of California. However much has changed since the Master Plan was written and our higher education system must respond to a host of issues never previously envisioned.
The Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education, which was established in March 2017, is conducting a thorough review of the Master Plan. Previous hearings provided an overview of the state’s higher education segments and workforce needs.

The Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California convenes at Fresno City College to discuss students’ needs.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Reform Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority Board of Directors,2021-02-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced AB 1091, legislation to reform the governance structure of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). Consistent with the findings of a 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, AB 1091 would reduce the size of the VTA Board and replace the elected Board of Directors with appointed members of the public.
“VTA provides essential public transit options that help get Santa Clara County’s two million residents to and from work, school, and home,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “However, three Civil Grand Jury Reports over the last 20 years have concluded that VTA’s governance structure is a root cause of the agency’s poor performance and is in need of structural reform. Taxpayers, transit riders, and VTA staff deserve a Board of Directors that have the interest and ability to dedicate the time necessary to provide appropriate oversight and meet our region’s complex transportation needs.”
According to the 2019 Civil Grand Jury Report, the VTA Board suffers from a lack of experience and continuity. VTA is currently composed of an 18-member board with 12 voting members, all of whom are current elected officials in Santa Clara County. The directors often have inadequate time to devote to the policymaking and oversight duties of VTA due to their primary focus on the demands of their elected positions. The Grand Jury Report recommended legislation to improve the governance structure of VTA, notably including appointed directors who are not currently serving as elected officials and have relevant transportation expertise.
AB 1091 would reduce the size of the VTA board from 12 voting members to 9 voting members: 5 members appointed by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, 2 members appointed by the City of San José, and 2 members appointed by the remaining cities in Santa Clara County. The appointed directors would be members of the public and would serve four-year terms. Relevant skill sets including professional experience in the transportation sector, accounting or finance, infrastructure or project management, and executive management would be represented on the board.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Create Office of School-Based Health Programs to Meet Needs of Students,2021-02-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), along with joint author Assemblymember James C. Ramos and coauthors Senators Susan Talamantes Eggman and Henry Stern, introduced Assembly Bill 563, which would, by July 1, 2022, establish a new office within the California Department of Education to ensure greater access to health care services at schools and draw down more federal funds.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in health care and education and highlighted the need for student health and mental health services,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Establishing the Office of School-Based Heath Programs will ensure a coordinated approach to assist schools in meeting the increased demand for student health and mental health services while using federal dollars and preserving state and local resources—a win-win.”
Through a program called the Local Educational Agency (LEA) Medi-Cal Billing Option Program (Program), K-12 schools have been eligible for federal reimbursement for direct health care services such as health evaluations, physician services, and mental health and counseling services to name a few. These school-based health services play a key role in ensuring that California students are healthy, safe, and ready to learn. Yet California has historically lagged behind other states in the amount of federal reimbursement it receives.
In fact, a September 2020 State Auditor report stated that LEAs have not consistently used the Program to obtain federal reimbursement for providing health services, including mental health. This Program represents a significant potential source of funds for LEAs, yet the State Auditor found that only 600 of the state’s 2,400 LEAs participate. Given the current challenges that students are facing, now more than ever there is an opportunity for the California Department of Education to play a vital role in increasing school participation and assisting schools that are currently providing health care services to their Medi-Cal students.
Additionally, to run smoothly and maximize funding, schools need support from state agencies responsible for both health and education. However, in California, there is no institutionalized partnership between the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, and the California Department of Education to coordinate health programs and services delivered through schools. The Office of School-Based Health Programs would fill this gap. The Office would facilitate coordination between these entities in order to maximize federal reimbursement and provide health care services to more students in California.
The bill is similar to AB 1322 from 2019 and is co-sponsored by the California School-Based Health Alliance, the California School Nurses Organization, the California School Boards Association, Teachers for Healthy Kids, and the California Association of Student Councils.
“It is more important than ever for health and education to work together in order to meet the tidal wave of student health and mental health needs. California's 293 school-based health centers know how important it is to work between the siloes of health and education to make health care accessible to the students who need it most. The California School-Based Health Alliance is excited to continue working with Assemblyman Berman to ensure that there is partnership and coordination between our state agencies at this critical moment,” said Tracy Mendez, Executive Director of the California School-Based Health Alliance. 
“Previous to July 2020, school districts could only be reimbursed for health services provided to Special Education students or 12% of students. In July, the federal government agreed to reimburse schools for services to all Medi-Cal eligible students, or over 50% of the school aged population. Currently health services are located within the Special Education unit at CDE. With this expansion, it is time to create a place to serve all students,” said Hellan Roth Dowden of Teachers for Healthy Kids.
“Children come to school every day suffering from mental health issues, poor nutrition, asthma, diabetes, and other conditions that seriously impact their ability to succeed. Schools are a critical partner in providing health services to students. California presently does not have a formal inter-agency relationship with the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) which oversees the Medi-Cal program. With the new expansion, we believe the time is now to fully develop and formalize the relationship between DHCS and CDE. We look forward to working with Assemblyman Berman to make this relationship a reality,” said California School Nurses Organization President Pam Kahn.
“Through the COVID-19 pandemic, where students are increasingly disconnected from their teachers and peers, millions of California students are struggling with their mental health in isolation. California is falling behind in providing the right mental health services to its students. This bill, with the robust leadership from Assemblymember Marc Berman, aims to assist our schools in maximizing its services and support of young people. The California Association of Student Councils is proud to join a coalition of advocacy groups prioritizing youth mental health in this once-in-a-lifetime crisis,” said Jason Chen, Governmental Affairs Policy Director for the California Association of Student Councils.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Legislation to Strengthen Election Transparency,2021-01-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) introduced the LLC Dark Money Ban Act, which strengthens California’s campaign contribution disclosure laws. Specifically, AB 236 requires a political committee that receives campaign contributions from a limited liability company (LLC) to disclose the name of each individual who owns or controls the LLC and the name of each individual who controls the contributions or expenditures of the LLC, and establishes conditions under which an LLC is required to disclose the true sources of money that it uses to make campaign contributions and expenditures in California.
“Wealthy donors should not be able to launder money through a shell corporation to hide their involvement in the political process,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, chair of the Assembly Elections Committee. “The LLC Dark Money Ban Act will increase transparency by closing a loophole in the law that allows big dollar donors to anonymously funnel money through LLCs to influence California voters.”
Under California law, an LLC can make campaign contributions or expenditures in the name of the LLC without disclosing any information about the source of the funds expended by the LLC or the individuals responsible for operating the LLC.
Last month, an LLC named “Prov. 3:9” made a $500,000 campaign contribution to a committee that was created to support an effort to recall Governor Gavin Newsom. At the time it made the contribution, no information was publicly disclosed about the source of funds that it used to support the recall effort. Prov. 3:9 originally was established in October 2018, and describes its business as “consulting services” in business filings made with the California Secretary of State. There is little evidence, however, that Prov. 3:9 actually engages in business in California. According to a complaint filed with the Fair Political Practices Commission, it has no website or social media presence, and it does not have a business license with the city where it is based. Last week, the manager of Prov. 3:9, LLC publicly stated that an Orange County-based investor is its sole financial backer, but Prov. 3:9 has not filed campaign disclosure reports to confirm that the investor is the true, original source of the money used to make the contribution in support of the recall effort. The campaign contributions made by Prov. 3:9, LLC are just one example of large campaign contributions made by LLCs for which little public information is available through public campaign disclosure reports.
Assemblymember Berman introduced similar legislation—AB 2407—in 2020, but did not move forward with the bill due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. AB 236 reflects the scope of AB 2407 and includes additional protections to ensure full transparency for LLCs, which in light of recent events, has made this change even more necessary.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Marc Berman Responds to Governor’s January Budget Proposal,2021-01-08,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to the unveiling of Governor Gavin Newsom’s January Budget proposal today. 
“Governor Newsom’s budget proposal offers hope and a path to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating impact it has had on our communities. Foundational to that is our ability to vaccinate California’s large and diverse population, safely reopen schools for in-person learning, and support job creation and small business recovery. I applaud Governor Newsom’s commitment of $372 million for vaccine distribution, a record $85.8 billion for K-14 education, including substantial funding dedicated to addressing learning loss and equity, and $575 million for grants and nearly $71 million in fee waivers for small business.
“I am particularly appreciative of Governor Newsom’s commitment to supporting the basic needs of college students, proposing $100 million in one-time funding for community colleges, $30 million ongoing for CSUs, and $15 million ongoing for UCs to address housing and food insecurity, mental health, and digital equity. I have heard from hundreds of students across California about their struggles to meet their basic needs, and I’ve championed legislation aimed at easing the burden for our most vulnerable students. 
“I look forward to working with Governor Newsom and my colleagues in the Legislature to provide immediate relief to Californians struggling from the COVID-19 pandemic and approving a budget that reflects the values and needs of our great state.”

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Condemns Violent Siege of the United States Capitol,2021-01-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to the violent siege of the United States Capitol today.
""Today we saw our nation's Capitol come under attack, an attempted coup to disrupt one of the foundational bedrocks of our democracy - the peaceful transition of power after a free and fair election. We are in the midst of the greatest threat our democracy has ever faced, an assault from fellow Americans who are being encouraged and emboldened by the President of the United States himself. 
“Trump and his enablers have been flirting with inciting civil war in our country for four years. For too long, elected leaders have enabled and excused this borderline treasonous behavior, turning a blind eye as his lies have steadily eroded faith in our civic institutions and turned Americans against one another. They believed they could foment hatred for their own personal political gains, yet stay above the fray and avoid culpability. They are wrong. We will remember their names, and we will not forget their seditious acts.
“Our democracy is stronger than these traitors. The fabric of our nation is being strained to its breaking point, but America will prevail.""

Marc Berman,Berman Applauds Governor’s Nomination of Dr. Shirley Weber for next California Secretary of State,2020-12-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Elections Committee, offered his congratulations to Assemblymember Dr. Shirley Weber on her nomination to become California’s next Secretary of State. 
""I want to congratulate my colleague and friend, Dr. Shirley Weber, on her historic nomination to become California’s next Secretary of State,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman. ""Dr. Weber is widely admired as one of the most principled members of the Legislature. As chair of the Assembly Elections Committee, I've had the pleasure of working with Dr. Weber to make California’s elections more inclusive and accessible for all Californians. As a member and former Chair of the committee, whose grandfather was never allowed to vote in the pre-voting rights south, Dr. Weber has worked tirelessly to protect and advance voting rights in California. I know that she will build upon that great work as our next Secretary of State.""
If confirmed by the Legislature, Dr. Weber would be the first African American woman to serve as Secretary of State in California. She would replace Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who Governor Gavin Newsom announced earlier today as his selection to serve as California’s next United States Senator.

Marc Berman,Berman Bill Would Make Recent Election Reforms Permanent,2020-12-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) will introduce legislation which would require elections officials to mail every active registered voter a ballot for all future elections and ensure that all California voters continue to have access to vote-by-mail ballot tracking. Similar requirements were implemented prior to the 2020 General Election in November and have since been credited with the state’s success conducting a safe and secure election during a global pandemic and boosting voter turnout to recent highs.
“In the face of a global health pandemic and an unprecedented onslaught of misinformation trying to undermine voters’ faith in our democracy, California conducted a secure and remarkably successful general election,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""Given the success of mailing every active registered voter a ballot, as well as other improvements we made in 2020, it only makes sense to make permanent many of the key changes adopted in response to the pandemic.”
In April, Assemblymember Berman amended his AB 860 to require that every active registered California voter receive a vote-by-mail ballot for the 2020 General Election. AB 860 also allowed counties to begin processing returned vote-by-mail ballots earlier, extended the deadline for receipt of vote-by-mail ballots, allowed voters to use remote accessible vote-by-mail systems, and ensured that all California voters had the ability to track their ballots as they moved through the mail system and were processed by elections officials (a system that was initially created by Berman’s AB 2218 in 2018). The bill was signed into law as an urgency measure in June, and was a key part of the state’s preparations for conducting a safe and successful presidential election during the COVID-19 pandemic. In all, approximately 15 million Californians voted in the General Election using a ballot that was mailed to them, and more than 4.5 million Californians registered for ballot tracking.
If signed into law, California would become the sixth state to require active registered voters to be mailed a ballot before each election. Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Utah already do so.

Marc Berman,Berman Moves to Make Key Election Reforms Permanent,2020-11-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, has announced he will introduce legislation to require that all active registered California voters be mailed a ballot for all future elections following the successful implementation of such a policy for the 2020 General Election.
""Our democracy is strongest when everyone participates,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “This year we saw historic levels of voter participation following the passage of AB 860, which required every county to send vote-by-mail ballots to all active registered voters. More than 68% of eligible Californians voted in the General Election, which was the highest turnout since at least 1960. Now that we know these changes were successful, I will introduce a bill in the new session to make permanent the key provisions of AB 860.""
In April, Assemblymember Berman amended his AB 860 to require that every active registered California voter receive a vote-by-mail ballot for the 2020 General Election. AB 860 also facilitated the surge in voting by mail by ensuring that all California voters had the ability to track their ballots as they moved through the mail system and were processed by elections officials (a system that was initially created by Berman’s AB 2218 in 2018). AB 860 was signed into law as an urgency measure in June, and was a key part of the state’s preparations for conducting a safe and successful Presidential General Election during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman to Host Health Care Affordability Panel,2020-10-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — On Monday, November 9th, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) will host a panel of health policy leaders to discuss their innovative solution for responding to the rising cost of health care.
Moderated by Vicki Veenker, Director of the California Health Reform Initiative (CHRI), the webinar will present the findings of a recent report released by the Convergence Center for Policy Resolution. The report was authored by a diverse set of health care policy stakeholders convened by CHRI to bridge ideological divides to bring down health care costs in California.
“I am thrilled to explore new solutions to make health care more accessible to every Californian,” said Assemblymember Berman. “This proposal, crafted by an ideologically diverse set of experts, is a model for collaborating to create good policy.”
“Our broad coalition came to a consensus that improving health care affordability requires greater transparency and accountability,” said Vicki Veenker. “There’s a lot of momentum behind their solution because of the recognition that we have to do something bold to effect the change we need in California.”
The panelists will discuss how this solution would contain health care costs in the wake of COVID-19. Garnering broad support from consumers, doctors, insurers, employers, and workers, this proposal was introduced last year by both Governor Newsom and Assembly Health Chair, Dr. Jim Wood.
The panelists include:

Marc Berman,"State Election Leaders, Umberg and Berman, Condemn Fake Ballot Boxes & Issue Warning to Partisan Perpetrators",2020-10-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Senator Thomas J. Umberg (D-Orange County), Chair of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments, and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, condemned the recent reports of unauthorized ballot drop boxes appearing throughout California. Metal containers marked “Official ballot drop-off box” have been popping up in gyms, gun stores, campaign headquarters, and even churches across the state in recent weeks, with Republicans urging voters to drop their ballots inside. As the Legislature’s elections experts, Senator Umberg and Assemblymember Berman are informing anyone involved in the Republican Party’s illegal activity that doing so may be a crime under California law.
“It is no surprise that President Trump supports this latest attempt at misleading voters. The Republican Party will stop at nothing in their desperate effort to try to erode the public’s trust in our election system,” said Senator Umberg. “Posting fake drop-off boxes in order to deceive voters and then complaining that mail-in ballots promote fraud is akin to robbing your own bank and then complaining about inadequate security.” Those setting up these boxes in an attempt to misrepresent themselves as election officials and subvert our Democracy must be punished.”
“Four years ago, California amended state law to allow a voter to designate any trusted person to return that voter’s completed vote-by-mail ballot. That law was based on a simple principle: that it shouldn’t be a crime for a voter to ask a neighbor, friend, or co-worker to help ensure that their vote is counted,” said Assemblymember Berman. “To be clear, while California law allows a voter to give their ballot to a trusted person to return, it does not allow private organizations to set up unsecure and unstaffed collection boxes, and to mislead voters into believing that they are operated by the elections officials that are charged with running elections.”
California Elections Code Section 18002 makes it a felony for a person to willfully neglect or refuse to perform a duty that is imposed on them under California’s election laws. When a voter designates another person to return the voter’s ballot, Elections Code Section 3011(a)(9)-(11) requires that designee to provide their name, relationship to the voter, and signature on the ballot identification envelope. It also requires that designee to submit that ballot within three days. People erecting these scam drop boxes are subject to criminal prosecution if ballots are not returned unscathed within the required timeframe. 
Voters who have dropped their ballots into one of these unauthorized drop boxes should know that California law ensures that their vote will be counted, notwithstanding the misconduct of the California Republican Party. To ensure that the appropriate elections official receives their ballot, voters should sign-up to track their ballot at http://wheresmyballot.sos.ca.gov/.

Marc Berman,Legislators React to Youth Suicide Prevention Audit,2020-09-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Yesterday the California State Auditor released a report on youth suicide prevention requested by Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), James C. Ramos (D-Highland), Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield) and Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach). The report found that school districts lack the resources and policies necessary to effectively address rising rates of youth suicide and self-harm.
“I remain committed to addressing the growing crisis of youth suicide in California, especially during this stressful and challenging time,” said Assemblymember Berman. “The audit identifies where we are falling short, and provides helpful recommendations for how California can ensure that all of our youth have access to critical mental health services. We must use this audit as a catalyst for change, and make the investment needed to protect our students’ health and safety.”
“The state auditor’s report on the lack of resources and policies for our children is a loud and clear call to action,” stated Ramos. “It serves to guide policymakers about what we need to do to help save the lives of our children. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Native American youth, and rural and Northern parts of our state are also hit hard by this tragedy which rips apart families and communities.”
“Any time a young person takes their own life, it is an absolute tragedy that weighs heavily on family, friends, student peers, teachers, and the community as a whole,” said Assemblymember Salas. “The State Auditor’s report reaffirms the need for action on the state and local level to better improve suicide prevention efforts. Schools and teachers are on the front lines of suicide prevention and we need to make sure they have the appropriate training and mental health resources to protect our students and prevent future tragedies.”
The audit found that from 2009 to 2018, the number of youth suicides increased by 15 percent statewide and self-harm incidents increased by 50 percent. No school reported employing the recommended number of school counselors, nurses, social workers, or psychologists. Further, 25 percent of schools did not employ a single mental health professional, and none of the six schools that were reviewed have adopted adequate youth suicide prevention policies or training. The audit recommends that schools employ more mental health professionals, invest in school-based health centers, and draw down federal reimbursement funds to provide mental health resources to students.
Assemblymember Rudy Salas (D-Bakersfield) and chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee requested the audit. In 2016, AB 2246 (O’Donnell) required schools to adopt a policy on pupil suicide prevention. In 2018, Assemblymember Berman secured $1.7 million to develop and disseminate an online suicide prevention training program to schools at no cost. In 2019, AB 1767 (Ramos) required schools serving students in grades K-6 to adopt and periodically update a policy on student suicide prevention. This year the Governor signed AB 2112 (Ramos), which authorizes the Department of Public Health to establish the Office of Suicide Prevention to address suicide and suicide prevention.

Marc Berman,California Legislature Moves to Protect Voters Rights Amid Pandemic,2020-08-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today, Senate Bill 423, authored by Senator Thomas J. Umberg (D-Santa Ana), Chair of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments, and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, was passed by the California State Senate with a bipartisan vote of 29-4.
SB 423 would protect public health and voting rights before the 2020 General Election by requiring California election officials to provide safe and accessible polling places or vote centers. Safe and accessible voting locations are critical for protecting voter rights for all Californians. For many voters, the services they need to vote privately and independently are available at polling sites. SB 423 guarantees that voters will have safe, secure, and convenient in-person opportunities to cast their ballots in case voting by mail is not a viable option for them for the statewide general election held on November 3, 2020. The measure requires county elections officials to establish, and maintain, a minimum number of polling places and vote centers.
“Safe and healthy in-person voting options this November are absolutely a necessity. Protecting the right to vote is a key part of our jobs as elected officials -- in spite of Donald Trump’s efforts to undermine, and cast aspersions on the voting rights of Californians and the upcoming election,” said Senator Umberg. “We will persist and ensure that there will be clean and sanitary voting locations that are able provide valuable services like Election-Day registration, language assistance with ballots, disability assistance with voting, and more.” California must make sure that there’s enough polling places in the communities that need them, and especially in underserved communities that have low rates of vote-by-mail usage.”
AB 860, jointly authored by Senator Umberg and Assemblymember Berman, was signed into law in June, requiring county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for the November election. Expanded use of voting by mail, paired with safe and sanitary polling locations, is the surest way to protect poll workers and voters alike. 
“By mailing every voter a ballot while also preserving the right to vote in person, we have ensured that the upcoming election will be safe, secure, and accessible for every voter throughout California,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous uncertainty, but one thing that’s for certain is that no Californian will be forced to jeopardize their health to vote.” 
Voting Locations Still Needed
While institutions and organizations across the state battle COVID-19, many of the venues that normally serve as polling places and vote centers--such as senior centers, churches, and private halls--may not be available. As of mid-July, half of California counties have indicated that they still need to secure and confirm voting locations for the General Election.
“Many counties are in urgent need of new polling locations that meet public health guidelines, including physical distancing,” Secretary of State Alex Padilla added. “We are working with all counties to identify and secure new locations and to recruit new poll workers, but each county is at a different level of readiness. I urge cities, schools, colleges, business owners, and community based organizations with facilities that can accommodate voting to consider hosting a polling location.”
“In 2018 Sacramento County was the largest county in California to pilot the Voter’s Choice Act – giving our voters options to register and cast their vote through a variety of ways,” said Courtney Bailey-Kanelos, Registrar of Voters, Sacramento County. “This flexibility and accessibility lead to not only record voter registration year over year, but record voter turnout. However, finding locations to host Vote Centers is harder than ever. In Sacramento we have only secured 39, less than half of our target of 84 locations. We’re asking that community organizations and businesses all over California partner with your local Elections Office to ensure all voters have a choice in how they vote this November.”
Any business or organization with a venue that may be suitable to serve as a voting location should contact their county elections office or the Secretary of State’s office at democracyatwork@sos.ca.gov.
SB 423 now awaits action by Governor Gavin Newsom.

Marc Berman,Berman Blasts Trump’s Latest Attempt to Exclude Immigrants from the 2020 Census,2020-07-21,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to an executive memorandum issued by President Trump earlier today to exclude immigrants from the 2020 Census:
""This memo isn't even worth the paper it's scribbled on,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman, chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census. ""Trump knows this - he couldn't even bring himself to make it an Executive Order. It's blatantly unconstitutional. It isn't even practical. The Supreme Court tossed Trump's citizenship question off of the census, so there's no way to know the citizenship status of the people who reply. If it's not legal, and it's not practical, then it's obviously just fear-mongering to try to suppress participation in the census, which has been Trump's goal the entire time. It's truly sad.""

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to GOP’s Dismissal of Vote-By-Mail Lawsuit,2020-07-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement today in response to the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the California Republican Party dropping their lawsuit against Governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order requiring California voters to be mailed vote-by-mail ballots for the General Election this November:
""I always expected these Republican organizations to dismiss their lawsuit,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""While the Governor's executive order was necessary to send an early signal to county elections officials so they could begin planning for the general election, it was really an insurance policy in case my bill, AB 860, ran into unexpected obstacles while moving through the legislative process. The Governor’s executive order was an important precaution since, as we've seen this week, the COVID-19 pandemic can unexpectedly interfere with the Legislature's ability to operate. In the end, AB 860 was approved quickly and with strong bipartisan support, because no Californian should have to risk their health - and possibly their life - to exercise their constitutional right to vote."" 
AB 860, which requires every active registered voter in California to be mailed a ballot for the 2020 General Election, was signed into law on June 18, 2020. SB 423 (Umberg), which would ensure that county elections officials establish and maintain a minimum number of polling places and vote centers for the November 3rd election, is pending in the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee.

Marc Berman,Newsom Signs Universal Vote By Mail Bill,2020-06-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Governor Gavin Newsom has just signed Assembly Bill 860, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Senator Tom Umberg (D-Orange County), requiring county elections officials to mail active registered voters a ballot for the General Election this November. The bill cleared its final hurdle in the Legislature earlier today, passing out of the Assembly with overwhelming bipartisan support.
""I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing AB 860 as soon as it reached his desk,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman, Chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee. ""Californians will start voting in just over 100 days. In the midst of a deadly health pandemic, mailing a ballot to every California voter, and giving them the opportunity to vote from the safety of their own home, is the responsible thing to do. No Californian should have to risk their health – and possibly their life – to exercise their constitutional right to vote.""
Approximately 78% of California’s active registered voters received a ballot in the mail before the March Primary Election this year. Since California held that election, at least 16 states either postponed their scheduled primary elections or switched them to vote by mail elections due to concerns that conducting in-person voting during the spread of COVID-19 threatens the health and safety of voters, election workers, and the public generally. In anticipation of heightened interest in voting by mail, AB 860 proactively ensures that active registered voters in California will receive a ballot in the mail.
Importantly, in-person voting opportunities would remain available for voters in a manner that protects the health and safety of voters and election workers. Senate Bill 423 by Senator Tom Umberg would require county elections officials to establish and maintain a minimum number of polling places and vote centers for the statewide general election on November 3, 2020. SB 423 was introduced alongside AB 860 and is currently in the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee.
“I commend the governor for recognizing the need for mail-in ballots to be sent to the voters of California as we face the difficulties brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic in our state. The state must prepare now for the elections in November, so that we protect our democracy,” said Senator Tom Umberg, Chair of the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee. “Sending California voters a ballot is only one part of the solution for a safe and fair election. We must also provide sanitary, in-person voting locations available to provide access to valuable services like Election-Day registration, language assistance with ballots, disability assistance with voting, and more. With AB 860 and SB 423 in place, California can be a leader in protecting the health of its voters while protecting their constitutional right to vote.”
Last week, Sutter County Superior Court Judge Perry Parker issued a temporary restraining order blocking Governor Newsom’s recent executive order that requires active California voters to be mailed vote-by-mail ballots for the November General Election and requires counties to make available a minimum number of polling places for voters to vote in person. Yesterday, the Third District Court of Appeals put a stay on the Superior Court’s temporary restraining order.
“California is moving in a swift, bipartisan manner, to fortify our democracy in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. “Expanding vote-by-mail statewide is a necessity to protect our right to vote and our public health. Voting by mail has worked safely and securely in California for decades. Mailing every voter a ballot for this election is simply common sense.”
The passage of AB 860 provides much needed clarity for elections officials and California voters about the conduct of this November’s Presidential General Election.

Marc Berman,"Assemblymember Marc Berman Joins State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, San Diego County Office of Education, and LivingWorks to Announce Suicide Prevention Training Initiative for California Teachers and Students",2020-06-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond announced today that the California Department of Education (CDE), in collaboration with the San Diego County Office of Education, is launching a free online suicide prevention training program available to middle and high school staff and students throughout the state.
“The COVID-19 pandemic not only disrupted the academic lives of our students and families, but it may have contributed to emotional and mental health challenges that some of our students struggle with,” said Thurmond. “It is important that students know that they have someone to turn to within their school community when they are feeling overwhelmed. Providing this specialized training to school staff and peers can not only be utilized to support students in crisis during the critical time we are in now, but any time a student is feeling despondent, stressful, and alone.”
The funding for the program was secured by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and included in Assembly Bill 1808, which was passed in 2018.
“One of my biggest highlights of 2018 was securing $1.7 million dollars to fund online suicide prevention training for California middle and high school staff and students,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""I'm thankful that the training program is being launched across the state, particularly during this challenging and unprecedented time. As students cope with school closures and isolation, it's absolutely critical that administrators, teachers, and students know what to look for and how to respond to help prevent youth suicide.”
The online training program is called LivingWorks Start, an evidence-based program that is aligned with CDE’s Model Youth Suicide Prevention Policy to address the needs of high-risk populations. According to a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth ages ten to twenty-four. For every youth who dies by suicide, an estimated 100 to 200 young people make suicide attempts.
“One thing that’s increasingly recognized in suicide prevention efforts is that you have to engage large numbers of people,” says Rick Trimp, president of LivingWorks. “When students are thinking about suicide, they’re likely to confide in a peer or a trusted teacher. Having students and teachers trained to recognize when someone is struggling and connect them to further help empowers the whole school community to come together and support those at risk.”
The San Diego County Office of Education was selected through a competitive application by the CDE to lead the effort and make the training available to local educational agencies (LEAs) through their respective county office of education. LEAs can choose to incorporate the program as an additional resource to an existing youth suicide prevention policy. 
“This is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” said Dr. Paul Gothold, San Diego County Superintendent of Schools. “By working with all 58 county offices of education to distribute this online training to their areas of greatest need, we are honoring the expertise, resources, and needs of each community.”
The program will be rolled out in two phases, with school site staff trained first and students trained during the second phase, which will take place in September. Having trained school personnel in place will allow students to receive the proper support when they go through the program and will help them be better equipped to support students who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide. Some of the training topics include how to recognize when someone is having suicidal thoughts, intervention strategies, and connections to support services.
For questions or more information, visit the San Diego County Office of Education’s Student Support Services web page or email Program Specialist Heather Nemour at heather.nemour@sdcoe.net.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman and Senator Umberg Respond to Temporary Suspension of Governor Newsom’s Vote-by-Mail Order,2020-06-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) and Senator Tom Umberg (D-Orange County) released the following statements in response to Sutter County Superior Court Judge Perry Parker’s issuance of a temporary restraining order blocking Governor Newsom’s recent executive order that requires California voters to be mailed vote-by-mail ballots for the November General election and requires counties to make available a minimum number of polling places for voters to vote in person:
""Today's lawsuit challenging the legality of Governor Newsom's Executive Order is exactly why, two days after the election debacle in Wisconsin in early April, I introduced legislation to require that every California voter receive a ballot in the mail for this November's General Election,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Chaos reigned in Wisconsin, where Governor Evers' Executive Order was overturned by the Wisconsin Supreme Court just days before their primary election, creating confusion over what the voting rules were and leading to the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters. While I am confident that Governor Newsom's Executive Order would prevail in California, the passage of AB 860 will provide certainty for our voters and our elections officials. I am proud that AB 860 received strong bipartisan support in the Senate, and I look forward to debating the bill in the Assembly and sending it on to Governor Newsom for his signature next week.""
“We should be confident that AB 860, and SB 423, will pass through the legislature and reaffirm the important goal of protecting the right to vote for all Californians,” said Senator Tom Umberg. “We should continue with preparations to provide every registered voter a ballot in a timely manner, and also provide safe and sanitary in-person voting locations. I commend Governor Newsom’s leadership for adopting these bills into an executive order.""
Earlier this year, Assemblymember Marc Berman introduced AB 860, which would require every registered voter in California to be mailed a ballot for the 2020 General Election. Senator Tom Umberg (D-Orange County) introduced SB 423, which would ensure that county elections officials establish and maintain a minimum number of polling places and vote centers for the November 3rd election.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman's Statement on the Murder of George Floyd,2020-06-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police: 
""Like you, when I saw the video of George Floyd’s murder I was shocked, outraged, and heart-broken. As the days went on, and protesters righteously took to the streets, my feelings transitioned into a combination of being consumed, overwhelmed, and frankly a bit paralyzed by what was going on.
""Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, Stephon Clark, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor. George Floyd. Those are just a few of the Black men and women – and even children – who have been killed either by police or vigilantes who saw the color of their skin, and immediately devalued the worth of their lives.
""What the hell is wrong with us?
""As a white man of privilege, I cannot begin to understand what my Black friends and constituents face on a daily basis. Therefore before speaking out, I wanted to listen. To the words of Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Killer Mike of Atlanta, who spoke so passionately of the pain they were feeling in the early morning hours this past Saturday. Or the words of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who so poignantly wrote that “Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible — even if you’re choking on it — until you let the sun in. Then you see it’s everywhere.” Or in private conversations I have had with Black community leaders in my district over the last few days.
""As long as people I have sworn to represent live in fear because of the color of their skin, I have failed. My grief and anger means nothing if I govern in a way that allows the systemic racism that has subjugated Black and other communities of color for centuries to persist. Whether it is an unwarranted suspension in school, an unjustified traffic stop, an unnecessary search, or one of the many other daily offenses, it is not a series of bad actions; it is a fundamentally failed system. The system must be changed.
""California has taken steps to correct some of these systemic flaws. We have reformed the inherently racist and discriminatory money bail system. We have passed legislation to restrain the use of force, reform sentencing guidelines that are used to target minorities, and acknowledge the role that unconscious bias plays in perpetuating racism in our society, from education to healthcare.
""We must do so much more. We must insist that our police, who are sworn to serve and protect, truly serve all Californians, and are not allowed to close ranks and protect their own at the expense of justice.
""We must increase police oversight, further limit the use of deadly force, hold people who commit these atrocities accountable, and dismantle the underlying racism that has led us to this day.
""But that is just the beginning. We must not become desensitized to the outrage that we feel right now. I am committed to working with my colleagues to make sure that we don’t return to normal, when normal has become the far too frequent murder of unarmed Black Americans by the police in broad daylight. It must be a constant focus and priority, factored into every action we take.
""I pledge to do everything I can to address these failures and heal our communities. As Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel once wrote: “Indifference to evil is worse than evil itself, [and] in a free society, some are guilty, but all are responsible.”

Marc Berman,Berman’s Vote By Mail Bill Clears First Hurdle,2020-06-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, is authoring legislation that would require every registered voter in California to be mailed a ballot for the 2020 General Election. That measure, Assembly Bill 860 (AB 860), cleared its first hurdle today, passing out of the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee, 4-1.
 
“No one should have to risk their health – and possibly their life – to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” said Assemblymember Berman. “There is a very real concern that we could see a surge in coronavirus cases in the fall. Mailing every California voter a ballot, and providing them with the opportunity to vote from the safety of their own home, is essential to ensuring that we can conduct an open, accessible, and safe election this November.”
Approximately 78% of California’s registered voters received a ballot in the mail before the March Primary this year. Since California held its statewide primary election, at least 16 states either postponed their scheduled primary elections or switched them to vote by mail elections due to concerns that conducting in-person voting during the spread of COVID-19 threatens the health and safety of voters, election workers, and the public generally. States that have held or are planning to hold primary elections after the spread of COVID-19 have reported substantial increases in the number of voters seeking to vote by mail. In anticipation of heightened interest in voting by mail, AB 860 (Berman) proactively ensures that all registered California voters will receive a ballot in the mail. Utah, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and Colorado also mail ballots to all registered voters.
 
Importantly, in-person voting opportunities would remain available for voters in a manner that protects the health and safety of voters and election workers. Senate Bill 423 by Senator Tom Umberg (D-Orange County), Chair of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments, would require county elections officials to establish and maintain a minimum number of polling places and vote centers for the statewide general election on November 3, 2020. The measure was introduced alongside AB 860 (Berman) in May to protect both public health and voting rights amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Assemblymember Berman and Senator Umberg announced the package of bills in a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom in which they expressed their concern over the impacts COVID-19 could have on the 2020 General Election and urged the Governor to issue an executive order requiring that all voters be mailed a ballot for the November election until that requirement can be formalized through the adoption of legislation. On May 8th, Governor Newsom issued the requested executive order, signaling to counties that they should begin preparations to guarantee every registered voter in California receives a ballot in the mail this fall. Since that time, at least two federal lawsuits have been filed challenging the validity of that executive order. In light of those lawsuits, it remains essential to enact AB 860 (Berman).
 
AB 860 (Berman) now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
 
The bill is supported by American Civil Liberties Union of California, Black Women for Wellness, California Calls, California Common Cause, California Donor Table, California Environmental Justice Alliance, California Federation of Teachers, California Labor Federation, California League of Conservation Voters, California School Employees Association, California Teachers Association, Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, Courage California, Disability Rights California, Inland Empire United, League of Women Voters of California, Million Voters Project, NARAL Pro-Choice California, Power California, SEIU California, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Responds to Governor Newsom’s Revised Budget,2020-05-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) released the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s revised budget:
""California is in an unprecedented economic crisis triggered by COVID-19, and we find ourselves confronting scenarios that we could not have imagined in our worst fiscal nightmares just three months ago,"" said Assemblymember Berman. ""While our strong budget reserves and fiscal prudence over the last decade will help soften the blow, we will need to make very difficult decisions in the coming months to close the projected $54 billion budget deficit.

Marc Berman,Senator Umberg and Assemblymember Berman Announce Legislative Package to Protect Voting Rights and Public Health in November,2020-05-06,press_release,NA,"(Sacramento, CA) – Today, Senator Thomas J. Umberg (D - Orange County), Chair of the Senate Committee on Elections and Constitutional Amendments, and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, announced legislation to protect public health and voting rights amid concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic before the 2020 General Election.
 
In a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, Senator Umberg and Assemblymember Berman expressed their concern over short- and long-term impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the November 2020 election. In their letter, they announced their legislative package to protect public health while safeguarding important and long-held voting rights. Namely, the letter and the accompanying legislation stipulate that the state must send a mail ballot to every registered voter, and that in-person voting options continue to be accessible to voters. Expanded access to vote-by-mail is a critical component of any plan to address the crisis, but California must also make every effort to continue to offer meaningful access to in-person voting polling locations that are safe and sanitary for poll workers and voters alike. The letter also calls on the Governor to issue an executive order to require that all voters be mailed a ballot for the November election. Such an order will signal to counties that they should begin procurement of equipment and materials to allow for every registered voter in California to receive a mail ballot until that requirement can be formalized through the adoption of legislation.
Assembly Bill 860 (AB 860), by Assemblymember Berman would require that every registered California voter receive a vote by mail ballot for this November’s presidential general election. In-person voting opportunities would remain available for voters in a manner that is consistent with the need to protect the health and safety of voters and election workers.
“No Californian should have to choose between protecting their health and safety and participating in our democracy, particularly when doing so can be easily avoided,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 860 strikes the appropriate balance between allowing Californians to vote from the safety of their own homes, and ensuring that those who wish to vote in person still have the ability to do so.”
Senate Bill 423 (SB 423) by Senator Umberg would require county elections officials to establish and maintain a minimum number of polling places and vote centers for the statewide general election to be held on November 3, 2020. Safe and accessible polling places are critical in ensuring voter rights are protected for all Californians. For many voters, the services they need to vote privately and independently are available at polling sites.
“Voters will need safe and healthy in-person voting options this November,” said Senator Umberg. “While it is critical that voters in California are afforded every opportunity to receive a mail ballot, there still must be reliably sanitary, in-person voting locations available to provide access to valuable services like Election-Day registration, language assistance with ballots, disability assistance with voting, and more.”
Advocacy groups from across the state applauded the call for a comprehensive plan for safe and fair election. In calling for the November election to be safe, fair, and inclusive of all voters, the following groups are joining forces: Black Women for Wellness, Brennan Center for Justice, California Calls, California Donor Table, California Environmental Justice Alliance, California Labor Federation, California League of Conservation Voters, Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, CHIRLA, Consumer Attorneys of California, Inland Empire United, NARAL Pro-Choice California, Power California and SEIU.

Marc Berman,Berman Announces New Bill to Protect Voters Before November Election,2020-04-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), Chair of the Assembly Committee on Elections and Redistricting, has announced he will introduce legislation to require that all registered California voters be mailed a ballot for the 2020 General Election.
“Californians should not have to risk their health – and possibly their lives – in order to exercise their constitutional right to vote in this November’s election,” said Assemblymember Berman. “The reality is that with the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not know what social distancing guidelines will be in place or whether or not the virus will make a resurgence in the fall. While we hope for the best, we must plan for the worst and avoid the debacle we witnessed in Wisconsin earlier this week. Guaranteeing that every California voter will have the opportunity to fill out their ballot in the safety of their own home is not only the smartest option, it should really be the primary option for how we conduct the General Election.”
Assemblymember Berman will amend his existing bill, AB 860, to require that every registered California voter receive a vote by mail ballot for this November’s presidential general election. Limited in-person voting opportunities would remain available for voters in a manner that is consistent with the need to protect the health and safety of voters and election workers.

For the March 2020 statewide primary election, approximately 78% of California’s registered voters received a ballot in the mail.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Reacts to Governor Newsom’s Budget Proposal,2020-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) issued the following statement in response to Governor Newsom’s January budget proposal:
“The budget that Governor Newsom unveiled today is a reflection of the bold and progressive values we hold dear in California. I am particularly impressed by the governor’s proposed investment in computer science education, including nearly $20 million for teacher training and resource coordination. Since my days working at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation, it has been a longstanding goal of mine to close the STEM education gap in California schools. In the 24th Assembly District, too few students have access to computer science courses, despite living in the heart of the Silicon Valley. 
“I am also encouraged by the governor’s proposed funding to support food pantries on community college campuses. In a recent survey of nearly 40,000 students at 57 California Community Colleges, half had experienced food insecurity in the previous month. We must do even more to address the basic needs challenges of our higher education students, including homelessness and housing insecurity.
“On a similar note, I am pleased to see the governor’s proposal to improve the quality of school meals, including funding to establish a Farm to School Grant Program to promote partnerships between California agriculture and schools. 
“As a strong advocate for universal preschool, I am very supportive of the governor’s proposal to fund 10,000 new full-day preschool slots. Children who attend high-quality preschools are more likely to go to college and earn higher wages. These news slots would put thousands of children on the path toward academic success and economic security.
“I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration over the next several months to refine and finalize the state budget, continuing to save for a rainy day while also tackling some of California’s most pressing challenges.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws",2019-12-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park) authored 16 bills this year that were signed into law. The legislation addresses a variety of issues, including gun violence prevention, deepfakes, sexual assault survivors, elections, poverty, the environment, education, transportation, consumer protection, and business.
Gun Violence Prevention
Assembly Bill 521 tasks the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center (Center) with establishing first-in-the-nation gun violence prevention education and training programs for medical and mental health providers. In addition to authoring the measure, Assemblymember Berman secured a one-time $3.85 million appropriation in the state budget for the Center to research, develop, disseminate, and evaluate the programs. Through the course of regular patient care, physicians have opportunities to assess patients for risk, provide evidence-based counseling, and intervene when necessary. Regrettably, many medical professionals cite lack of knowledge regarding when and how to discuss firearms with their patients as a principal barrier to action. This new initiative follows the emergence of the #ThisIsOurLane movement in 2018, in which doctors shared their experiences treating victims of gun violence on Twitter in response to a tweet from the NRA telling them to stay in their lane.
Deepfakes
Assembly Bill 602 requires consent to be obtained prior to depicting a person in digitally produced sexually explicit material (i.e. a deepfake), allows that consent to be rescinded within three business days unless certain conditions are met, and creates civil remedies. An exposé in The Washington Post explained how deepfake technology is disproportionally being used to harass and humiliate women by scraping photos of women from the internet and manipulating them into nonconsensual porn. Filmmakers can also abuse the technology during post-production of mainstream content by depicting an actor in the nude or engaging in sexual activity.
Assembly Bill 730 prohibits a person, committee, or other entity, within 60 days of an election, from distributing, with actual malice, materially deceptive audio or visual media (i.e. a deepfake) of a candidate with the intent to injure the candidate’s reputation or deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate. Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous new technology with the potential to sow misinformation and discord among an already hyper-partisan electorate. Earlier this year, a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demonstrated that even videos modified using rudimentary editing tools can be harmful. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that deepfakes have the potential to incite violence, alter election outcomes, and undermine diplomacy.
Sexual Assault Survivors
Assembly Bill 538 improves the availability, efficiency, and quality of medical evidentiary examinations (“rape kits”) for sexual assault survivors. After enduring a sexual assault, timely access to trauma-informed and evidence-based care is necessary to prevent adverse health outcomes and for the proper collection of evidence. Unfortunately, California has a shortage of trained forensic examiners, with only 49 exam teams serving all 58 counties.
Elections
Assembly Bill 504 streamlines and clarifies the process for keeping the state’s voter registration database up-to-date. It also allows voters to keep their voter registration active by logging in to the Secretary of State’s “My Voter Status” website. This provision does not take effect until the Secretary of State updates the VoteCal database so that county elections officials are notified when a voter confirms their address on the “My Voter Status” site.
Assembly Bill 566 requires elections officials to regularly update the Secretary of State on the remaining number of unprocessed ballots during an official canvass period. As Californians continue to embrace voting-by-mail and transition to vote center voting, the number of ballots that need processing during the official canvass period will continue to grow. Current law does not require counties to provide regular updates to the Secretary of State on the number of ballots still to be processed following an election.
Assembly Bill 623 enhances the voting experience by providing elections administrators more flexibility to design ballot layouts that are user friendly and compatible with new voting systems. Specifically, the new law requires the Secretary of State to establish a ballot design committee and work with county elections officials and ballot design experts to make recommendations for better ballot design and format. The law was inspired by a constituent from the 24th Assembly District who, when discussing an upcoming election with Assemblymember Berman, was under the impression he could only vote for one city council candidate, not the three votes that were permitted.
Assembly Bill 693 allows Californians who register to vote on Election Day to cast a regular (non-provisional) ballot if the county elections official uses VoteCal to confirm the voter’s eligibility, verify that the voter has not already voted in that election, and confirm that the voter is not included on another county’s roster. The county elections official is also required to update the VoteCal record to indicate that the voter has voted in the county. VoteCal, which was established in 2016, allows a county elections official to access and update the statewide voter registration database in real time. By allowing county elections officials to offer non-provisional ballots to eligible voters that meet the above requirements, the new law will improve voter confidence and reduce wait times to vote.
Assembly Bill 1707 allows voters to use a cell phone or tablet at a polling place, provided that the use of the device does not violate other provisions of existing law such as photographing or recording a voter entering or exiting a polling place with the intent of dissuading another person from voting. Doing so will allow for voters to access the state voter information guide online or retrieve information or notes about how they planned to vote. In addition, many counties are taking steps to modernize the voting experience. For example, Los Angeles County is rolling out Voting Solutions for All People (VSAP). One of the innovations to be incorporated within VSAP is the ability for voters to load sample ballots from their cell phones or tablets onto the new voting terminals. 
Poverty
Assembly Bill 494 maximizes food benefits for low-income families by simplifying how they verify their housing costs. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known as CalFresh in California, provides monthly food benefits for qualified, low-income households to purchase food. CalFresh serves over four million Californians and plays a crucial role in reducing the short and long-term impacts of poverty.
Environment
Assembly Bill 782 allows a public agency to fund and acquire property to preserve open space, habitat, or historical resources without first going through a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review. The new law builds upon existing CEQA guidelines, in which transfers of land ownership to preserve existing natural conditions and historical resources are exempt. In doing so, the law removes barriers such as cost, time, and legal challenges that could prevent the acquisition from ever occurring.
Education
Assembly Bill 988 helps address the special education teacher shortage by streamlining the credentialing process for out-of-state teachers to teach in California. Specifically, the new law allows out-of-state special education teachers to use two years of teaching experience in California, earned while holding a Preliminary credential, to demonstrate the teaching experience requirement needed to obtain a Clear (full) credential. The teaching experience requirement has been a barrier that discourages trained and qualified out-of-state special education teachers from teaching in California, exacerbating the already alarming teacher shortage.
Transportation
Assembly Bill 1671 allows for the California Department of Transportation to continue on-road testing of Driver Assisted Truck Platooning (DATP) technologies by extending the current sunset to January 1, 2024. DATP allows trucks to safely follow each other with less than 100 feet of following distance by syncing acceleration and braking, which is known as platooning. DATP technologies can enhance safety, improve traffic flow stability, reduce congestion, and lower fuel consumption considerably. The new law continues California’s tradition of leading in innovative technologies that focus on driver safety and reducing emissions.
Consumer Protection/Business
Assembly Bill 1065 indefinitely extends the ability of insurers to offer consumers the option of electronic transactions for their insurance needs, which provides enhanced consumer choice, faster delivery, a paperless environmentally friendly option, and portability. In the aftermath of a disaster, the ability for consumers and insurers to conduct transactions electronically can accelerate the recovery process.
Assembly Bill 1146 ensures that nothing in California’s landmark consumer privacy law – the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 – would prevent the sharing of vehicle information for the purpose of enabling repairs covered by a warranty or a manufacturer’s recall. This clarification will ensure that consumers receive important and timely vehicle safety information and retain the ability to have their vehicle repaired.
Assembly Bill 1564 requires a business that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a consumer whom it collects personal information from to provide an email address for consumers to exercise their rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The new law strikes a balance between the need for greater flexibility for exclusively online businesses and protecting hard-earned privacy protections for consumers. Providing an email address is consistent with how consumers engage with businesses online and enables these businesses to work within best practices to verify and respond to CCPA requests. Given the potential legal liability for improper disclosures of personal information, documentation of a consumer’s request, the verification process, and the information provided in response is critically important.

Marc Berman,California Reconsiders Election Ballot Layout,2019-10-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Yesterday Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 623, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which would provide county elections officials more flexibility to update and improve ballot layouts for voters.
“Poor ballot design affects all voters and can result in the disenfranchisement of millions of votes,” said Assemblymember Berman, chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee. “With the influx of state and federal funding last year to replace and upgrade aging voting equipment, and with recent changes to the voting process to make voting more accessible, the time is right to allow counties to review and update the design of ballots. AB 623 gives counties that flexibility and will enhance the voting experience for California voters.” 
AB 623 was inspired by a constituent from the 24th Assembly District who, when discussing an upcoming election with Assemblymember Berman, was under the impression he could only vote for one city council candidate, not the three votes that were permitted. This led Assemblymember Berman to realize that a lack of clarity may prevent voters from fully exercising their right to vote. 
Under California state law, ballots must follow certain requirements, such as instructions to voters, font type, font size, margin widths, spacing of contests, voting square size, and write-in spacing, among other prescribed formats and conditions. According to county elections officials, many of these requirements are outdated and can create barriers for elections officials to design ballots that comply with best practices for readability. Furthermore, these requirements can be incompatible with new voting systems and methods of conducting elections.
AB 623 requires the Secretary of State to establish a ballot design committee and work with county elections officials and ballot design experts to make recommendations for better ballot design and format. Additionally, AB 623 removes various outdated Election Code sections related to ballot layouts and font types.
AB 623 was sponsored by the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and was supported by Secretary of State Alex Padilla, Disability Rights California, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.

Marc Berman,California to Establish First-in-the-Nation Gun Violence Prevention Training Program for Doctors,2019-10-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 521, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which tasks the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center with establishing firearm violence prevention education and training programs for health care providers.
“Despite repeated calls for a public health approach to ending the gun violence epidemic in this country, we have failed to equip our medical and mental health providers with the education and training they need to help reduce the high levels of gun violence their patients are experiencing,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, a member of the Legislature’s Gun Violence Prevention Working Group. “AB 521 fixes that. By training doctors when and how to discuss firearms with their patients, and what to do when a patient is in immediate danger, doctors will be equipped not only to respond to gun violence, but also to help prevent it.”
Californians experience firearm-related death and injury at an unacceptably high rate. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 3,184 gun-related deaths in California, including 1,610 suicides and 1,435 homicides. Furthermore, mass shootings are changing the character of public life. Last November, a mass shooting at Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California resulted in 12 deaths, and more recently, in July, a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival killing three people, including two children.
For decades, we have relied on doctors, emergency room nurses, and trauma surgeons to save lives in the aftermath of gun violence. In 2010, the estimated cost of hospital and emergency department care for firearm-related injuries in California was $112 million, with Medi-Cal and other government payers responsible for 64% of those costs. These high costs occur even though most people who die from firearm-related injuries do so at the scene of the shooting and receive no medical care for their injuries. Medical costs make up approximately 2% of the total cost of firearm-related harm, which is driven primarily by losses in productivity and quality of life. 
“This program will be the only one of its kind in the country,” said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center. “California health professionals are committed to making firearm violence prevention part of their practice, and we are very excited by the opportunity to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need.”
AB 521 recognizes that medical and mental health providers are uniquely positioned to both respond to and prevent firearm-related harm. Through the course of regular patient care, they have opportunities to assess patients for risk, provide evidence-based counseling, and intervene when necessary. Regrettably, many cite lack of knowledge regarding when and how to discuss firearms with their patients as a principal barrier to action.
Major medical associations, including the American College of Physicians, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have issued similar statements calling for a public health approach to reducing firearm-related injury and death. In 2017, the Board of Trustees of the California Medical Association noted that “expanded education and training are needed to improve clinician familiarity with the benefits and risks of firearm ownership, safety practices, and communication with patients about firearm violence.” The Board further stated that “medical schools and residency programs should incorporate firearm violence prevention into their academic curricula” and “California-specific resources such as continuing medical education modules, toolkits, patient education handouts, and clinical intervention information would help to address this practice gap.”
In 2016, California established the first-in-the-nation center devoted to firearms research. AB 521 furthers the work undertaken by the team of experts at the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center. The Budget Act of 2019 includes $3.85 million one-time General Fund for firearm violence prevention training. AB 521 provides clear guidelines for the use of those funds.

Marc Berman,Berman Continues to Champion Improved Care for Sexual Assault Survivors,2019-10-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 538, joint authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) and Assemblymember Evan Low (D-Campbell), which modernizes and improves forensic and medical care for sexual assault survivors.
“Unfortunately, a sexual assault occurs every 92 seconds in America,” said Assemblymember Berman. “While we work to reduce the frequency of these crimes, we must also ensure that survivors have access to trauma-informed and evidence-based care, especially in the more rural parts of California. I was pleased to partner with sexual assault forensic examiners this year to pass AB 538, which will do just that.”
According to a National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, one in three women and one in six men in the United States have experienced sexual violence. After enduring sexual assault, timely access to medical and forensic care is necessary to prevent adverse health outcomes and for the proper collection of evidence. Survivors are asked to undergo a highly sensitive and detailed examination, during which qualified health care professionals gather the patient’s medical and recent sexual history, record the patient’s account of the sexual assault, provide medical care, perform a full body examination, document physical findings, photograph injuries, and collect and package evidence for crime lab analysis.
The proper identification, collection, and documentation of evidence is integral for crime laboratories to establish DNA profiles, for law enforcement to identify offenders, for district attorneys to successfully prosecute defendants, and for survivors to witness justice in court. Unfortunately, access to qualified health care professionals with the advanced knowledge and clinical skills to provide appropriate forensic and medical care to patients is limited. With only 49 exam teams serving all 58 counties in California, some survivors must travel long distances to receive an exam. Barriers to access such as this reduce the likelihood of receiving timely medical care and allow evidence to degrade.
AB 538 addresses access by ensuring the financial stability of exam teams statewide, and by clarifying that nurse practitioners and physician assistants can perform exams. Furthermore, AB 538 enhances the quality and efficiency of exams by updating existing law to reflect current best practices, protect the confidentiality of forensic records, and advance education and training for examiners.
“By signing AB 538, Governor Newsom has protected survivor access to sexual assault forensic exam (SAFE) teams in California,” said Kim Walker on behalf of the California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners Association, the sponsor of the bill. “This bill ensures qualified healthcare professionals are appropriately trained to perform these vital exams in a compassionate, trauma informed manner and optimizes the health care response that survivors of sexual assault both require and deserve. Cal SAFE would like to thank Assemblymember Berman and Assemblymember Low for offering AB 538 and for their tireless support for survivors.”
Supported by a broad coalition of sexual assault forensic examiners, law enforcement, local government, and student activists, AB 538 received bipartisan support in the Legislature.
Assemblymember Berman has been a strong advocate for sexual assault survivors since being elected to the Assembly in 2016. His first year in office, Assemblymember Berman joint authored the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights (AB 1312, Chapter 692, 2017). Last year, Assemblymember Berman authored legislation (AB 1619, Chapter 939, 2018) to extend the statute of limitations for the recovery of civil damages related to a sexual assault endured as an adult.

Marc Berman,California Clamps Down on Nonconsensual Deepfake Pornography,2019-10-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 602, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, which enacts civil penalties for creating and disclosing nonconsensual digitally produced sexually explicit material.
“When deepfake technology is abused to create sexually explicit material without someone’s permission, it can cause irreparable harm to a victim’s reputation, job prospects, personal relationships, and mental health,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Women are disproportionately being harassed and humiliated when their photos are scraped from the internet and seamlessly grafted into pornographic content. AB 602 will ensure that Californians are protected from this abuse.”
Filmmakers can also use deepfake technology in mainstream content to depict an actor performing in the nude or as engaging in sexual activity without consent or participation. In post-production, filmmakers now have tools to remove underwear, create a digital replica of the individual, or to place the head of a performer on the real body of another.
Deepfakes are hyper-realistic images and recordings of an individual appearing to do or say something that the person, in fact, did not do or say. Created by powerful AI technology, deepfakes make it increasingly difficult to differentiate between truth and fiction.
“We are absolutely thrilled that Governor Gavin Newsom stood by the victims, most of whom are women, of nonconsensual pornography by signing AB 602 into law,” said Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists President Gabrielle Carteris. “AB 602 is a victory for all Californians. Deepfake technology can be weaponized against any person. Every person deserves the basic human right to live free from image-based sexual abuse.”
AB 602 will help restore control over an individual’s image or likeness by requiring consent to be obtained prior to depicting a person in digitally produced sexually explicit material and by allowing that consent to be rescinded within three business days unless certain conditions are met. The bill also provides victims with a robust set of remedies in civil court.
Sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the bill received bipartisan support in the Legislature and had no opposition.

Marc Berman,New Election Integrity Measure Signed into Law in Anticipation of 2020 Election Misinformation Campaigns,2019-10-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 730, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which will help shield voters from misinformation about candidates before the 2020 election. 
“Voters have a right to know when video, audio, and images that they are being shown, to try to influence their vote in an upcoming election, have been manipulated and do not represent reality,” said Assemblymember Berman, Chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee. “In the context of elections, the ability to attribute speech or conduct to a candidate that is false – that never happened – makes deepfake technology a powerful and dangerous new tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage misinformation campaigns to confuse voters. In the face of total inaction at the federal level, California must step up to protect our more than 20 million voters. AB 730 will help deter nefarious deepfakes by holding accountable the bad actors who intentionally attempt to injure a candidate’s reputation or deceive voters into believing a candidate said or did something they never said or did.”
AB 730 prohibits a person, committee, or entity, within 60 days of an election, from distributing, with actual malice, materially deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate with the intent to injure the candidate’s reputation or to deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate, unless the media includes a disclosure stating that it has been manipulated. The bill authorizes a candidate to seek injunctive or other equitable relief and general or special damages, if the media does not include the required disclosure.
Earlier this year, the manipulation of a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose speech was altered to make it seem as though she was inebriated, was very low quality and clearly fake, yet it was still viewed over three million times online. Deepfakes, which are hyper-realistic and therefore more challenging to distinguish from legitimate media, have the potential to be even more disruptive. By blurring truth and fiction, deepfakes make it easier to pass off fake events as real and to dismiss real events as fake – a phenomenon dubbed “the liar’s dividend.”
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that deepfakes have the potential to incite violence, alter election outcomes, and undermine diplomacy. As reported by The Washington Post, “a video of Gabon’s long-unseen president Ali Bongo, who was believed in poor health or already dead, was decried as a deepfake by his political opponents and cited as the trigger, a week later, for an unsuccessful coup by the Gabonese military.”
In January, then US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that deepfakes will probably be among the tactics used to disrupt the 2020 election. Earlier this year, the US House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, led by Congressman Adam Schiff, convened a hearing on the National Security Challenge of Artificial Intelligence, Manipulated Media, and “Deepfakes,” noting that “deepfakes raise profound questions about national security and democratic governances, with individuals and voters no longer able to trust their own eyes or ears when assessing the authenticity of what they see on their screens.” Senator Marco Rubio has also said that he expects deepfakes to be used in “the next wave of attacks against American and Western Democracies.”
In anticipation of the expanded use of this technology, UC Berkeley professor and image-forensics expert Hany Farid is developing a system to detect deepfakes of Donald Trump and the 2020 democratic presidential candidates. Additionally, last month, a new law in Texas went into effect, making it a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and/or a fine of up to $4,000, to create and distribute a deepfake video within 30 days of an election with the intent to injure a candidate or to influence the result of an election.

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Changes to Safe Lots Bill,2019-09-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement today in response to amendments that were made to AB 302 in the Senate Appropriations Committee:
“I was sad to see the details of the amendments that were forced into AB 302 by the Senate Appropriations Committee, which indicate a lack of urgency in addressing the community college student homelessness crisis in California and unnecessarily further a stigma that prevents them from seeking help.
“Though neither a permanent nor perfect solution, AB 302 would have, in its previous form, provided meaningful security for thousands of homeless community college students whose only reliable shelter is their car. Without a safe place to go at night, these students are forced into dark alleyways and industrial parks, where they are most vulnerable to harm.
“The recent amendments to dramatically weaken the opt-out provisions and delay implementation an additional 15 months weaken the bill to the point that it fails to address the reality that our students are facing today.
“Even worse, the amendment to exempt community colleges located within 250 feet of an elementary school is detrimental to our efforts to encourage these homeless students to seek help. Homeless students are not pedophiles that need to be kept away from children. They are men and women – many of them barely adults themselves – who are trying to improve their lives by obtaining a better education. They should be celebrated, not stigmatized.
“I am also unaware of any elementary school students attending school between 9pm and 7am, which is when Safe Lots programs typically operate.
“Therefore, I have decided to make AB 302 a two-year bill. I plan to spend this fall working with the governor’s office to identify ways to more urgently alleviate the struggles that our community college students are facing every day, in a way that treats them with the dignity and respect they deserve.”

Marc Berman,Berman Celebrates Census Victory,2019-07-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the Trump Administration’s decision to abandon its effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census:
“The decision to print the 2020 Census forms without a citizenship question is a huge victory for all of California’s 40 million residents. California is a big, beautiful, diverse state, and every Californian has the right to have their voice heard in the Census count,” said Assemblymember Berman, chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census. “Today’s announcement gives every Californian the confidence that they need to participate in the 2020 Census, which is critically important to their families and their communities.”
Last week the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the addition of a citizenship question, unconvinced by the Commerce Department’s justification for including it.

Marc Berman,Berman Successfully Advocates for Nearly $4M in State Budget for Gun Violence Prevention,2019-06-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to securing $3.85 million in the California State Budget for the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center to create gun violence prevention training programs for health care providers:
“In hospitals across the state, doctors are too frequently confronted by the tragic consequences of gun violence,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Now, we are enabling them to help prevent gun violence in the first place. The #ThisIsOurLane movement made it clear that there is strong support among health care providers to do more when it comes to preventing gun violence, and they are uniquely positioned to do so. While providing routine patient care, physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, nurses, social workers, and other therapists have opportunities to assess patients for risk, provide counseling, and intervene when emergencies arise. This funding is critically important to ensure that the medical community has the education and training needed to help curb gun violence before tragedies unfold.”
Assemblymember Berman advocated for the funding noting California’s high rate of firearm-related death and injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that there were 3,184 gun-related deaths in California in 2017.
Earlier this year, Assemblymember Berman introduced legislation, Assembly Bill 521, calling on the Center to establish multifaceted education and training programs to teach both medical and mental health providers how to counsel patients about firearm safety and what to do when patients pose a threat to themselves or others. The bill is currently pending in the Senate Public Safety Committee, and if signed, would provide guidance to the Center as to how to use the funding. 
In October 2018, the American College of Physicians issued new recommendations for physicians to help reduce firearm violence, encouraging them to “discuss with their patients the risks that may be associated with having a firearm in the home and recommend ways to mitigate such risks.” In response, the National Rifle Association tweeted they should “stay in their lane,” which sparked outcry from physicians and surgeons who responded by sharing their own experiences treating patients in the aftermath of firearm-related violence.
While many health care providers recognize their obligation to help prevent firearm-related death and injury, many cite lack of knowledge as the principal barrier to action.
In a position statement on firearm-violence prevention, the California Medical Association stated that, “expanded education and training are needed to improve clinician familiarity with the benefits and risks of firearm ownership, safety practices, and communication with patients about firearm violence.”
“Medical professionals know that appropriate discussions of firearm safety can help prevent firearm-related death and injury, and that such discussions are well within their scope of practice,” said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center. “This initiative will provide them with the knowledge, skills, and resources they need to help protect the health and safety of their patients and communities.”
In 2016, the Legislature authorized and appropriated funding for the University of California to establish a Firearm Violence Research Center. Since then, UC Davis has assembled a team of experts in firearm-related death and injury, specifically in provider and patient education to prevent firearm-related harm.

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to Supreme Court Ruling on Census Citizenship Question,2019-06-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census:
“This morning’s decision by the Supreme Court to temporarily prohibit the citizenship question from being placed on the Census is a short-term victory for all Californians,” said Assemblymember Berman. “While there is still some uncertainty as to whether this unnecessary question will be included, there is no question that the Trump administration is intentionally and systematically trying to intimidate Californians and stifle our voices.
“Whether you were born here 90 years ago, or moved here yesterday, you are a Californian. Californians don’t get bullied, and we don’t get intimidated. No matter what happens with this question, the work continues to make sure every person in California gets counted in the census. And at the end of the day, California will be stronger for these efforts.”

Marc Berman,"Berman Introduces Legislation to Combat Nefarious ‘Deepfakes,’ Protect Election Integrity",2019-06-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has introduced legislation in response to growing concerns about the use of ‘deepfakes’ to interfere in the 2020 election and influence political discourse. Assembly Bill 730 would prohibit a person, within 60 days of an election, from knowingly or recklessly distributing deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate with the intent to injure the candidate’s reputation or deceive a voter into voting for or against the candidate, unless specified disclosure requirements are met. 
“Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous new technology that can be weaponized to sow misinformation and discord among an already hyper-partisan electorate,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Deepfakes distort the truth, making it extremely challenging to distinguish real events and actions from fiction and fantasy. AB 730 seeks to protect voters from being tricked and influenced by manipulated videos, audio recordings, or images before an election.”
While high quality deepfake videos can be very difficult to detect, even low-quality video manipulation can spread quickly on social media platforms and cause harm. The manipulation of the video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose speech was altered to make it seem as though she was drunk at a speaking engagement, was very low quality but was still viewed over three million times.
That is why ‘deepfakes,’ – computer-generated photos and videos that are nearly impossible to detect – are even more threatening. The widely available artificial intelligence technology allows for the creation of lifelike photos and videos of someone falsely appearing to say or do something. By blurring truth and fiction, deepfakes make it significantly easier to pass off fake events as real and dismiss real events as fake.
If signed into law, AB 730 would allow a registered voter to seek injunctive and other equitable relief prohibiting the distribution of the deceptive audio or visual media, defined as an “image or audio or video recording that has been intentionally manipulated in such a manner that it would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the candidate.” A candidate whose voice or likeness appears in the deceptive audio or visual media could also seek general or special damages.

Marc Berman,"Safe Lot Bill Gains Momentum, Passes the Assembly",2019-05-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to Assembly Bill 302 passing out of the Assembly today with bipartisan support. Championed by Berman and sponsored by the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, the bill would require community colleges to grant overnight access to campus parking facilities for homeless students to sleep in their vehicles.
“Student homelessness has reached a crisis point across California, and the safety of our students warrants immediate attention,” said Assemblymember Berman. “While we work towards the long term solution of building more housing, this is a significant step we can take to ensure that the tens of thousands of homeless students living out of their cars have a safe place to sleep at night.”
A recent report released by the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and The Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice, which surveyed nearly 40,000 students at 57 community colleges, found that 19% of respondents experienced homelessness in the previous year. Extrapolated to California’s community college population of 2.1 million students that means nearly 400,000 students have experienced homelessness in the last year.
Assembly Bill 302 would require community colleges to grant overnight access to campus parking facilities to any homeless student that is enrolled in coursework, has paid enrollment fees if not waived, and is in good standing with the community college, without requiring the student to enroll in additional courses. The governing board of each community college would be required to develop an implementation plan that includes, in part, an overnight parking form and liability waiver, designation of a specific parking area or areas, accessible bathroom facilities, hours of operation, and overnight parking rules. Further, AB 302 importantly specifies that it is the intent of the Legislature that homeless students who use the overnight parking facilities shall be connected to available state, county, community college district, and community-based housing, food, and financial assistance resources.
The bill previously passed out of the Assembly Higher Education Committee and the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill now heads to the Senate.
Assembly Bill 302 is also supported by the Alliance for a Better Community, Alliance for Children's Rights, California Faculty Association, California School Employees Association, California YIMBY, Dreams for Change, Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, Homeless United Huntington Beach, LifeMoves, Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter, NextGen California, Safe Parking LA, South Bay YIMBY, and Western Center on Law & Poverty.

“AB 302 passing out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee today with unanimous bipartisan support moves us one step closer to making safe lots a reality for California's homeless community college students.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Responds to Governor’s May Revision to State Budget,2019-05-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has released the following statement in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s May revision to his proposed 2019-2020 state budget:
“As a former executive at a nonprofit that focused on improving access to STEM education in underprivileged communities, I am thrilled that Governor Newsom has proposed to create and fund a California Computer Science Coordinator. This is very similar to the proposal I outlined in AB 20, and I am really pleased that Governor Newsom shares the view that this new position will provide tremendous value as the state implements new computer science standards and strives for every student to have access to computer science courses.
“As chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee, the strength and security of our voting systems - the foundation of our Democracy - is of utmost concern to me. I'm grateful to the governor for proposing an additional $87.3 million to replace and upgrade county voting systems throughout California. This investment is critical to the security of California’s election infrastructure.”

Marc Berman,Lawmakers Call for More Californians to Join the Bone Marrow Donation Registry,2019-05-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Assembly adopted Assembly Concurrent Resolution (ACR) 70, designating May 2019 as Bone Marrow Donation Awareness Month in California. The resolution, introduced by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), seeks to raise awareness about the need for more Californians to join the bone marrow donation registry.

“Every three minutes, someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer or other blood disorder,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “Patients in need of a bone marrow transplant rely on the selfless commitment of strangers for a cure. I joined the registry, and I hope many more Californians will join me in taking this essential step to save lives.”
Seventy percent of all patients who need a bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or cord blood transplant do not have a matched donor in their family and depend on the Be The Match Registry to find an unrelated donor or cord blood unit.
Be The Match operates the world’s largest and most diverse registry of potential bone marrow donors, including more than 20 million potential donors and 295,000 cord blood units. Since 1987, Be The Match has facilitated more than 92,000 marrow and umbilical cord blood transplants.
Unlike blood donation, patients seeking a bone marrow donor are more likely to match with someone who shares their ethnic background. Given the current composition of the Be The Match Registry, the likelihood of finding a match for a patient in need of a transplant ranges from 23 to 77 percent, depending on the patient’s ethnic background. In order to ensure that all patients have an equal chance of finding a match regardless of ethnic background, Be The Match has a specific need to increase awareness among African Americans, Latinos, Asian and Pacific Islander Americans, Native Americans, and other underrepresented ethnic groups.
ACR 70 was inspired by five-year-old Norah Gratz-Lazarus, who was diagnosed with Fanconi anemia —a gene disorder that is so rare that only an estimated 30 children in the United States are diagnosed with it each year. Without a matching bone marrow donor, Norah has more than a 90 percent risk of developing leukemia or other serious bone marrow diseases.
“Our family is grateful to have the strong support of the Assembly, our community, and countless Californians who have discovered how easy and necessary it is to sign up to be a potential donor,” said Zach Gratz-Lazarus, Norah’s father. “We urge all Californians to consider signing up for the registry because many lives—including that of my precious, young daughter—depend on finding the right match.”
Unfortunately, Norah’s family is hardly unique. California ranks first nationwide for patients searching for a match. Between 2013 and 2018, 6,335 California residents were in need of a life-saving donor.
The bone marrow donor registration process only takes a few minutes and requires a simple cheek swab. Join the Be The Match Registry today.

Marc Berman,Effort to Combat Covert For-Profit Colleges Continues,2019-04-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, a bill authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) to prevent covert for-profit colleges from evading state oversight passed out of the Assembly Higher Education Committee with bipartisan support. This legislation is joint-authored by Assemblymembers Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, David Chiu, Susan Talamantes Eggman, Evan Low, and Kevin McCarty.
AB 1341, one of seven bills being considered by the Legislature to regulate the for-profit college industry, would require the Attorney General to determine whether a postsecondary educational institution qualifies as a nonprofit corporation or public institution of higher education, as defined in the bill. A decline in enforcement of nonprofit status by the federal Internal Revenue Service has opened the door for for-profit colleges to use devious financial maneuvers to claim nonprofit status – all the while skirting consumer protections that generally come with such status.
“Without enforcement or oversight, covert for-profit colleges will continue to mislead and prey on students,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Because we cannot rely on the U.S. Department of Education to solve this problem, California must step up to protect our students. I am proud to author AB 1341, which will prevent covert for-profit colleges from evading state oversight and hold them accountable to our students, not their shareholders.”
For example, Grand Canyon University was previously a for-profit college. However, it reorganized and split off its real estate and academic-related assets in order to claim nonprofit status. The remaining piece of the for-profit company, Grand Canyon Education, Inc., contracted with the nonprofit college to provide recruiting, counseling, human resources, and marketing services. In exchange, the for-profit company would take about a 60% share of the tuition, fees, room, and board revenue earned by the nonprofit college. Further, the President of the nonprofit Grand Canyon University is also the CEO of the for-profit Grand Canyon Education, Inc.
“For-profit colleges are trying to fool consumers and regulators by laying claim – illicitly – to the “nonprofit” and “public” labels, capitalizing on, but ultimately destroying, the good reputation of public and nonprofit schools,” said Robert Shireman, Senior Fellow and Director of Higher Education Excellence at The Century Foundation. “It is unfortunate that state action is necessary to stop this abuse. But the failure of oversight at the federal level, combined with some cynically opportunistic for-profit school owners and executives who have taken advantage of the situation, has made state action essential.”
Ashford University, owned by Bridgepoint Education, Inc., has already stated that it would follow Grand Canyon University’s lead and claim nonprofit status. In November 2017, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued Ashford University for misrepresenting tuition fees and financial aid availability to prospective students. The Chronicle of Higher Education investigated Ashford University and published its findings online, calling the school “a poster child for the ills of the for-profit college sector.”
“As a former Enrollment Services Advisor for Ashford University, I saw first-hand how its business is run, and calling it a “nonprofit” does a disservice to students when it is still owned by Bridgepoint Education, Inc.,” said Eric Dean. “When education is used as a tool to boost the profits of the owners, we have failed California students, which is why I fully support AB 1341.”
Assemblymembers David Chiu, Evan Low, Susan Talamantes Eggman, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, Kevin McCarty, and Jose Medina are also authoring legislation to provide appropriate oversight and scrutiny of for-profit colleges.

Marc Berman,Berman and Students Promote Safe Lot Legislation for Homeless Students,2019-04-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) is convening a press conference to discuss Assembly Bill 302, his measure requiring community colleges to grant overnight access to campus parking facilities for homeless students to sleep in their vehicles. A recent report released by the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and The Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice, which surveyed nearly 40,000 students at 57 community colleges, found that 19% of respondents experienced homelessness in the previous year. Extrapolated to California’s community college population of 2.1 million students that means nearly 400,000 students have experienced homelessness in the last year.

“The reality is that students are sleeping in their vehicles right now, and when we don’t provide a safe place for them to sleep, we force them into the shadows – into dark alleys and industrial parks – where they are most vulnerable,” said Assemblymember Berman. “We can no longer pretend that community college student homelessness isn’t a crisis – we have the data that clearly says it is. Shame on us if we turn our backs on these students and choose to ignore them.”
As Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, Assemblymember Berman convened five informational hearings throughout the state during the 2017-2018 Legislative Session. He heard heart-wrenching stories from some students who found themselves homeless and sleeping in their cars because they could not afford the cost of housing.
""I spent about two years homeless, as a full-time worker and full-time student, with my car as my only consistent place to sleep in,"" said Matthew Bodo, a student at Foothill College. ""AB 302 will allow students to stay, safely, in an area where homelessness is not criminalized, and nearby to resources that California community colleges provide them.""
Assembly Bill 302 would require community colleges to grant overnight access to campus parking facilities to any homeless student that is enrolled in coursework, has paid enrollment fees if not waived, and is in good standing with the community college, without requiring the student to enroll in additional courses.
The governing board of each community college would be required to develop an implementation plan that includes, in part, an overnight parking form and liability waver, designation of a specific parking area or areas, accessible bathroom facilities, hours of operation, and overnight parking rules.
“The biggest challenge I faced when I was a student living in my car was having no safe place to park overnight where I could rest or have time to catch up on my homework,” said Anthony White, a student at Palomar College. “AB 302 requires community colleges to make a small change, but it can give students the chance at success that can be life changing.”
Further, AB 302 importantly specifies that it is the intent of the Legislature that homeless students who use the overnight parking facilities shall be connected to available state, county, community college district, and community-based housing, food, and financial assistance resources.
""Student homelessness is very real and very unfortunate,” said Iiyshaa Youngblood, president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, the sponsor of AB 302. “AB 302 is not the perfect solution, but it is a step in the right direction. This bill will give homeless students a semblance of relief and connect them with the necessary city, district, or county resources, which would aid the students in finding suitable housing. We have to start somewhere because our current efforts are failing our most vulnerable students.""
The bill will be heard in the Assembly Higher Education Committee later this afternoon and is also supported by the Alliance for Children’s Rights, the California School Employees Association, California YIMBY, Dreams for Change, the Faculty Association of California Community Colleges, LifeMoves, the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Social Workers, NextGen California, and Safe Parking LA.
“AB 302 is an important step towards providing a safe, legal space for students to sleep while we work to provide adequate housing for every college student during their academic career,” said Shahera Hyatt, director of the California Homeless Youth Project. “When we have numbers of student homelessness as high as we do, we should have a bias toward action. For these reasons, we applaud Assmblymember Berman’s efforts to better serve this student community.”

Marc Berman,State Leaders Kick Off Final Year of Census Preparation,2019-04-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) joined key state leaders, advocates, and community members for a press conference to highlight California’s efforts to ensure a complete and accurate count in the 2020 Census. Among them were Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, and Dolores Huerta. The press conference kicked off the 2020 Census Call to Action, a week-long effort to raise awareness about the federal decennial census.

Photo credit: Assembly Democratic Caucus
“The 2020 Census will shape California’s future for the next decade. Accurate Congressional representation and billions of dollars in federal funding are at stake,"" said Assemblymember Marc Berman, chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census. ""California is a big, bold, beautiful, diverse state – and because of that, we’re also the hardest to count in the country. With 365 days until the start of the 2020 Census, I am grateful for all of our community partners who are actively engaging our most vulnerable and hard-to-count populations whose participation is critical to our success in securing a complete and accurate count of all Californians.”
The United States Constitution requires the United States Census Bureau to conduct a survey of everyone living in the country every ten years. Census data is then used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives and to distribute billions of dollars in federal funding for healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The California Department of Finance estimates that for every Californian not counted in 2020, state and local governments will lose $1,950 per resident per year. 
California has historically been difficult to count due to its size and diversity. More than 20 percent of California’s populated areas are considered “hard-to-count” – regions where the self-response rate to the census questionnaire has been low. Federal inaction, a new untested method of response to the census questionnaire, and the possibility of a widely-criticized citizenship question will further exacerbate difficulties reaching California’s immigrant and low-income communities.
That is why California has made an unprecedented investment in education and outreach, and is organizing earlier than ever before, with better coordination.
State leaders have made a significant commitment to support statewide census outreach and communication efforts by investing $100.3 million toward strategies and activities that will help ensure an accurate and successful count in California. Governor Newsom’s FY 2019-20 proposed budget includes an additional $54 million to bolster the state’s efforts. Funding will be divided for a statewide media campaign, including local ethnic media, to help close any gaps in especially vulnerable and hard-to-count communities as well as distribution to regional, county, tribal, and local government for outreach and associated programmatic costs. 
Last year, the California Census Office convened a series of meetings throughout the state to provide information about the state’s census outreach strategies and facilitate local planning for the 2020 Census. Informed by those meetings, the California Census Office is developing a statewide community-engagement campaign that supplements the United States Census Bureau’s efforts and is intended to reach the hardest-to-count communities throughout California.

Marc Berman,"No Slowing Down When It Comes to Preparing for the 2020 Census, State Leaders Say",2019-03-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), Senator Dr. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), and Senator Thomas Umberg (D-Santa Ana) are convening a joint hearing of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census and the Senate Select Committee on the 2020 United States Census.
“California has made a significant investment in preparing for the 2020 Census, and state, regional, and community leaders have been collaborating over the last year to come up with a strategy to ensure every Californian is counted,” said Assemblymember Berman. “With a year to go, it’s critically important that we work even harder to reach out to our hard-to-count communities. The stakes are too high not to.”
One year before the federal decennial census, the hearing serves to update members of the Legislature and the public on the state’s preparation efforts thus far and explore how California can further prepare to ensure a complete and accurate count of all California residents.
Representatives from the California Complete Count – Census 2020 Office (California Census Office) are joining with partners from county government and regional community-based programs to share details about the parallel planning that is underway to reach all Californians and ensure full participation in the 2020 Census.
“We need to be sure everyone is counted, because for every person undercounted, California and local governments will lose significant federal funding and our voices won’t be heard through representation in government,” said Dr. Richard Pan. “As we confront the mammoth task of counting all people living in California, the work we do now to prepare and the resources we devote to the effort will be instrumental to an accurate census.”
On April 13, 2018, Governor Brown issued an executive order (B-49-18), establishing the California Complete Count Committee to lead the state’s census preparation efforts. State leaders have made a significant commitment to support statewide census outreach and communication efforts by investing $100.3 million toward strategies and activities that will help ensure an accurate and successful count in California. Governor Newsom’s FY 2019-20 proposed budget includes an additional $54 million to bolster the state’s efforts. Funding will be divided for a statewide media campaign, including local ethnic media, to help close any gaps in especially vulnerable and hard-to-count communities and distribution to regional, county, tribal, and local government for outreach and associated programmatic costs. 
“We are grateful for the investment that California has made to support census outreach,” said Senator Umberg. “Having an accurate count is critical to ensure that California receives its fair share and that we receive adequate representation.” 
Last year, the California Census Office convened a series of meetings throughout the state to provide information about the state’s census outreach strategies and facilitate local planning for the 2020 Census.
Informed by those meetings, the California Census Office is developing a statewide community-engagement campaign that supplements the United States Census Bureau’s efforts and is intended to reach the hardest-to-count communities throughout California.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Honors Palo Alto Resident Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as Woman of the Year,2019-03-04,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D- Palo Alto) has the distinct privilege of recognizing Palo Alto resident Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the 24th Assembly District ‘Woman of the Year’. As a way to highlight outstanding women during Women’s History Month, legislators select one exceptional woman from each Assembly District to honor for her contributions to the community and the state of California.
“It is my honor to recognize Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the 24th Assembly District’s ‘Woman of the Year.’ In a remarkable act of courage, Dr. Ford put the country ahead of her own well-being, speaking out in the most public way imaginable about her sexual assault,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Dr. Ford exhibited strength and dignity under the most extraordinary conditions, and in telling her truth, she paved the way for countless other survivors to tell their own.”
Dr. Ford is a Biostatistician and Research Psychologist. Since 1998, she has worked in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford School of Medicine. She is also a Professor of Psychology in the Stanford-PGSP Consortium for Clinical Psychology, a collaborative program between Palo Alto University and Stanford University.
In the summer of 2018, Dr. Ford contacted her local representative and ultimately came forward publicly to tell the United States Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been sexually assaulted by then U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford’s decision to come forward and share the details of her painful personal experience was a courageous act of citizenship and sent a searing message across the country that there is power in not remaining silent. 
“I thank Assemblymember Berman for publicly recognizing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the 24th Assembly District ‘Woman of the Year’,” said Senator Connie M. Leyva (D-Chino), Chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus. “Dr. Ford’s tremendous courage and strength are a testament to her civic duty and she will forever be an inspiration to countless Americans—including me—that believe survivors who are willing to risk everything to tell their truth.”
Under immense scrutiny and pressure, Dr. Ford remained steadfast in her truth and inspired legions of sexual assault survivors to speak up and to know that they will be believed, no matter whom their attacker was or how long ago the attack occurred. Dr. Ford was embraced by a generation of young women as a role model for her refusal to be intimidated.
“Over the last few years we have seen women rise up together despite setbacks that force important issues to remain in the shadows,” said Assemblymember Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara), Vice-Chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus. “Dr. Ford is an example of the bravery required to do right thing. I am honored to join Assemblymember Berman in recognizing Dr. Ford for the example she has set for generations to come.”
Dr. Ford’s testimony was a pivotal moment in the history of this nation. Her bravery came at an incalculable price – threats to her safety and security, efforts to undermine her credibility, and loss of her anonymity – but it forever changed the nation’s conscience.
Assemblymember Berman will present Dr. Ford with her award at a private event later this month.

Marc Berman,Berman and Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Prevent Covert For-Profit Colleges from Evading State Oversight,2019-02-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) along with Assemblymembers Bauer-Kahan, Chiu, Eggman, Low, and McCarty have introduced legislation to prevent for-profit colleges from skirting oversight and deceiving students.

“As the Trump administration and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos abdicate their responsibility to protect students, California’s role becomes even more critical,” said Assemblymember Berman. “For-profit colleges are using complicated financial schemes and shell corporations to pose as nonprofit and public institutions. They are evading state oversight and misleading students. AB 1341 will protect students from their deceptive tactics and ensure that appropriate oversight remains.”
Nonprofit colleges have traditionally been required to devote all of their revenue to their educational purpose and prohibited from profit taking. However, a decline in enforcement of nonprofit status by the federal Internal Revenue Service has opened the door for for-profit colleges to use devious financial maneuvers to claim nonprofit status – all the while skirting consumer protections that generally come with such status.
For example, Grand Canyon University was previously a for-profit college. However, it reorganized and split off its real estate and academic-related assets in order to claim nonprofit status. The remaining piece of the for-profit company, Grand Canyon Education, Inc., contracted with the non-profit college to provide recruiting, counseling, human resources, and marketing services. In exchange, the for-profit company would take about a 60% share of the tuition, fees, room, and board revenue earned by the non-profit college. Further, the President of the non-profit Grand Canyon University is also the CEO of the for-profit Grand Canyon Education, Inc.
Without enforcement or oversight, these covert for-profits will continue to mislead and deceive students. In fact, Ashford University, owned by Bridgepoint Education, Inc., has already stated that it would follow Grand Canyon University’s lead and claim nonprofit status. In November 2017, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued Ashford University for misrepresenting tuition fees and financial aid availability to prospective students. The Chronicle of Higher Education investigated Ashford University and published its findings online, calling the school, “a poster child for the ills of the for-profit college sector.”
AB 1341 would prevent covert for-profit colleges from evading state oversight by requiring the Attorney General to determine whether a postsecondary educational institution qualifies as a nonprofit corporation or public institution of higher education, as defined in the bill.
AB 1341 is one of seven bills in a package intended to provide greater oversight and scrutiny of for-profit colleges. The other six are authored by Assemblymembers David Chiu, Evan Low, Susan Talamantes Eggman, Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, Kevin McCarty, and Jose Medina.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Prevent Spread of Malicious Deepfakes,2019-02-19,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has introduced legislation to criminalize the nefarious creation and distribution of deepfakes - hyper-realistic video or audio recordings of someone appearing to say or do something that the individual did not say or do.
“Deepfakes distort the truth, making it harder to distinguish real events and actions from fiction and fantasy,” said Assemblymember Berman. “While California is often the leader in advancing new technology, we cannot allow deceptive video and audio recordings to be weaponized against individual people, communities, or the public at large. Deepfakes are already being used to harass women, and they have the ability to cause further harm by inciting violence, manipulating elections, and undermining national security. Assembly Bill 602 will prevent the spread of deepfakes that are created with malicious intent.”
If enacted, Assembly Bill 602 would make it a misdemeanor to create or distribute a deepfake that is “likely to deceive any person who views the recording” or that is “likely to defame, slander, or embarrass the subject of the recording.” Modeled after California’s revenge porn law, doing so would be punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for up to one year, a fine not exceeding $2,000, or both imprisonment and a fine. Deepfakes that are “satire or parody, or that otherwise, because of content, context, or a clear disclosure, would not cause someone to believe that it is real,” would be protected under the bill.
Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence technology that seamlessly superimposes the movements and words of one person onto another. As a result, deepfakes make it harder to combat the spread of disinformation and potentially easier to dismiss real events as fake. This free, easily accessible technology is also disproportionally being used to humiliate women by scraping photos of women’s faces from the internet and manipulating them into sexually-explicit material.
In response to the growing threats of deepfakes, the Department of Defense, through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), has tasked researchers across the country with developing ways to identify deepfakes. Researchers at the University of Colorado in Denver are currently trying to create convincing deepfakes for use by companies, such as SRI International in Menlo Park, California, to develop technology that can in turn detect deepfakes.
A similar bill, the Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act of 2018, introduced by Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) expired shortly after being introduced in Congress last December. Under that bill, the creation and distribution of a deepfake that “would facilitate criminal or tortious conduct” would have been punishable by a fine or imprisonment up to two years, or up to ten years if the deepfake “could be reasonably expected to affect the conduct of any administrative, legislative, or judicial proceeding” or cause violence.

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Bill to Enhance Care for Sexual Assault Survivors,2019-02-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has introduced Assembly Bill 538 that will improve the availability, efficiency, and quality of medical evidentiary examinations for sexual assault survivors.
“After enduring a sexual assault, survivors deserve timely access to trauma-informed, evidence-based care,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Ensuring that they do can prevent adverse health outcomes and allow for the proper collection of evidence that is integral to law enforcement’s ability to apprehend offenders, for district attorneys to successfully prosecute defendants, and for survivors to seek justice in court.”
According to a National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, one in three women and one in six men in the United States have experienced sexual violence.
After experiencing sexual violence, many survivors choose to have an invasive and lengthy (several hours) medical evidentiary examination performed, during which qualified healthcare professionals gather the patient’s medical and recent sexual history, record the patient’s account of the sexual assault, perform a full body examination, provide routine medical care, and collect and document evidence.
Due to evidence degradation, timely access to medical evidentiary examinations is critical. Unfortunately, access to qualified healthcare providers that conduct medical evidentiary examinations is limited, and some survivors must travel long distances to receive a medical evidentiary examination.
Assembly Bill 538 would, in part, update existing law to reflect best practices, expand the types of qualified healthcare professionals that can perform medical evidentiary examinations, and enhance professional education and training. The measure would also protect the confidentiality of forensic records.
“The California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner Association, which represents the 49 sexual assault forensic examination teams in California, is pleased to sponsor AB 538,” said Kim Walker on behalf of the California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner Association. “We are grateful for Assemblymember Berman’s leadership in authoring legislation that is critical to providing survivors with supportive care after a sexual assault.”
Insufficient access to timely and quality medical evidentiary examinations is an issue across the United States. On February 7, 2019, Senators Patty Murray (D-WA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), among others, introduced bipartisan legislation – the Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act – to improve and expand access to health care services for sexual assault survivors.

Marc Berman,New Bill Seeks to Expand Firearm Safety and Violence Prevention Training for Doctors,2019-02-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) introduced legislation enlisting medical and mental health providers in the state’s struggle to prevent firearm violence.
“Despite objections from the NRA, doctors are well within their ‘lane’ in responding to and preventing gun violence,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman. “In hospitals across the state, doctors are too frequently confronted by the tragic consequences of firearm violence. It’s time we equip the medical community with the education and training they need to help prevent gun violence before these tragedies unfold.”
California experiences unacceptably high rates of firearm-related death and injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that there were 3,184 gun-related deaths in California in 2017.
Under Assembly Bill 521, the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center would establish multifaceted firearm-safety education and training programs for medical and mental health providers, launch a comprehensive dissemination program, and conduct rigorous research and evaluation of the programs’ effectiveness.
Medical and mental health care providers – physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists, nurses, social workers, and other therapists – are uniquely positioned to help prevent all forms of firearm-related harm. Through the course of their regular patient care, they have the opportunity to identify individuals at risk for such harm, provide evidence-based counseling on risk reduction, and intervene when emergencies arise.
In October 2018, the American College of Physicians issued new recommendations for doctors to help reduce firearm violence, encouraging them to “discuss with their patients the risks that may be associated with having a firearm in the home and recommend ways to mitigate such risks.” In response, the National Rifle Association tweeted for doctors to “stay in their lane,” which sparked outcry from physicians and surgeons who took to social media to share their professional experiences with firearm-related violence and its consequences.
While many medical and mental health providers recognize their obligation to help prevent firearm-related death and injury, many cite lack of knowledge as the principal barrier to action.
In a position statement on firearm violence prevention, the California Medical Association noted that, “expanded education and training are needed to improve clinician familiarity with the benefits and risks of firearm ownership, safety practices, and communication with patients about firearm violence.” 
“Medical professionals know that appropriate discussions of firearm safety can help prevent firearm-related death and injury, and that such discussions are well within their scope of practice,” said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Firearm Violence Research Center. “This initiative will provide them with the knowledge, skills, and resources they need to help protect the health and safety of their patients and communities.”
In 2016, the Legislature directed – and approved funding for – the University of California to establish a Firearm Violence Research Center. Since then, UC Davis has assembled a team of experts in firearm-related death and injury, specifically in provider and patient education to prevent firearm-related harm.
Governor Newsom’s budget proposal extends funding for the Center, providing $1 million on an ongoing basis.

Marc Berman,Berman Reacts to Newsom’s First State of the State Address,2019-02-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to Governor Newsom’s first State of the State address today:
“I applaud Governor Newsom for delivering an ambitious first State of the State, unveiling a clear vision for the future. While he touched upon California's exceptionalism, the Governor focused on the extraordinary challenges that we still face, speaking to the everyday issues that matter to residents across our great state. I look forward to working with Governor Newsom and my colleagues in the Legislature to break down barriers to building more housing, ensure every child goes to a school where they gain the skills they need to succeed, increase access to clean drinking water throughout California, including in the coastal communities of the 24th District, and create an economic system where people who work full time make enough money to support their families.”

Marc Berman,Berman Introduces Safe Lot Legislation for Homeless Community College Students,2019-02-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has introduced legislation that would allow homeless community college students to sleep in their vehicles overnight in campus parking facilities.
“Over the last two years, I've heard from too many students that they don’t have stable housing and often end up sleeping in their cars. Unfortunately, this is all too common throughout California, with one in four community college students experiencing homelessness,” said Assemblymember Berman. “The long term solution is to build more housing, but while we work to make that a reality, AB 302 is a step that we can take now to ensure that homeless students have a safe place to sleep at night.”
If signed, Assembly Bill 302 would require community colleges to grant overnight access to campus parking facilities to any homeless student that is enrolled in coursework, has paid enrollment fees, and is in good standing with the community college without requiring the student to enroll in additional courses. The bill would further compel each community college district governing board to develop a plan to implement the new requirement.
In 2016, Governor Brown signed AB 1995, requiring community colleges to grant access to campus shower facilities to homeless students who meet the same qualifications.
""As students, we chose to dedicate ourselves to pursuing a better life using education as our primary tool. We sacrifice everything; a growing number of us have even sacrificed our most basic human need, a place to call home. We had to decide if we were going to buy books or pay rent. We chose to stay steadfast in our commitment and follow our dreams,” said James Tompkins, a student at Bakersfield College. “Being a homeless student means lots of coffee to hide the sleepless nights walking or driving aimlessly and having extra deodorant in case you don't make it to campus early enough to shower before class. Being a student and chasing our dreams is worth being homeless.""
The Chief Executive Officers of the California Community Colleges established an Affordability, Food & Housing Access Taskforce in spring of 2018 to provide system-wide recommendations to address housing and food insecurities faced daily by community college students. On January 28, 2019 the Taskforce released draft recommendations, which included providing overnight parking to homeless students at California community colleges.
Over the last two years, Assemblymember Berman convened five hearings of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California, where he and the Select Committee heard powerful testimonies from students who shared experiences of housing insecurity and homelessness.

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Newsom Budget,2019-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to Governor Newsom’s budget:
“Governor Newsom’s budget proposal charts an ambitious path forward, investing in critically needed programs and services while continuing to save for an economic downturn.
“I was excited to see that Governor Newsom’s budget proposal includes unprecedented funding for higher education. These vital investments demonstrate a commitment to California’s students and future, and will help California keep its promise of accessible, affordable, and high quality higher education.
“As the leader of the Assembly’s efforts on the 2020 Census, I also applaud the governor for including $50 million for census preparation. As the nation’s hardest-to-count state, every dollar is critically important to the success of a complete and accurate count. I look forward to working with the Newsom administration and my colleagues to ensure all Californians are counted in the 2020 Census.”

Marc Berman,"New Year, New Laws: Legislation Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman to Take Effect on January 1, 2019",2018-12-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) authored 12 bills this year that will go into effect on January 1, 2019. The legislation is related to a variety of issues, including sexual assault survivors, the 2020 Census, student welfare, elections security, and health care.
Sexual Assault Survivors
Assembly Bill 1619 extends the statute of limitations for an adult sexual assault survivor to file for civil damages from two years to ten years. The previous two year window was unrealistic for many survivors, including those who were waiting for their evidence to be processed or for a criminal investigation or trial to end.
2020 Census
Assembly Bill 2592 requires the Secretary of State to include information about an upcoming federal decennial census on the Secretary of State’s website and in public elections materials that are produced by the Secretary of State such as the state voter information guide. Voter information is particularly timely because California’s 2020 Presidential Primary is only weeks before Census Day. An undercount of California’s population could significantly reduce the state’s share of federal funding for education, transportation, health care, and other vital services.
Student Welfare
Assembly Bill 2639 requires schools serving students in grades 7 to 12 to review their pupil suicide prevention policies every five years, and update them if necessary. Doing so will help ensure that schools continue to support students’ mental health needs, which is critically important as youth suicide rates continue to rise.
Assembly Bill 3043 improves access to school nutrition programs by allowing schools to use their cafeteria funds to provide Universal Breakfast, a program that provides a free nutritious breakfast to all students, and to purchase food trucks, which create additional points of access to school meals.
Election Security
Assembly Bill 3075 creates the Office of Elections Cybersecurity within the Secretary of State’s office and tasks it with defending the state’s election infrastructure from cyber threats, coordinating election security efforts with federal, state, and local elections officials, and counteracting false or misleading information that undermines the integrity of elections.
Health Care
Assembly Bill 2941 requires health plans and health insurers to provide access to medically necessary health care services to patients who have been displaced by a governor-declared state of emergency. Under the new law, health plans and health insurers could authorize care to be provided by an out-of-network provider, extend filing deadlines for claims, suspend prescription refill limitations and allow prescriptions to be refilled at an out-of-network pharmacy, relax time limits for referrals, and allow for medical equipment or supplies to be replaced. This bill follows another year of destructive wildfires, including the Camp Fire – the deadliest wildfire in the state’s history. 
Housing
Assembly Bill 1804 promotes residential and mixed-use housing projects within unincorporated county lands.
Courts
Assembly Bill 1531 builds upon Assemblymember Berman’s 2017 bill, AB 976, and further modernizes California’s court electronic-filing and service process.
Assembly Billy 2230 extends from 60 to 75 the number of days for a judge to rule on motions to set aside or vacate a judgement. Beginning January 1, 2020, the bill will also give judges the flexibility to more efficiently manage cases by allowing an outline of the discovery issues in dispute in lieu of full separate statements from both the plaintiff and defense counsel. This often tedious task is timely and can add up to reams of paper without any benefit for judges, parties, or the public.
Government
Assembly Bill 3133 requires the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency to serve on the State Public Works Board when natural resource-related acquisitions and projects are up for consideration, thereby ensuring that the State Public Works Board considers environmental and resource protection-related rationales for proposed land acquisitions. The State Public Works Board is responsible for overseeing and approving the land acquisition transactions for the majority of state departments.
Assembly Bill 2425 modernizes how an assessor or taxpayer may receive information related to property taxation by creating the reciprocal right of an assessor or taxpayer to request the information be mailed to them or sent electronically if available, thereby avoiding in-person visits and long lines at a county office.
Consumer Protection
Assembly Bill 2469 requires beer wholesalers to meet qualifications related to the quantity, storage, and ownership of beer stock. These qualifications – similar to those required of brandy and distilled spirits wholesalers – are needed to ensure that beer wholesalers have the functionality to maintain beer freshness, provide quality control, and protect the public from unsafe products.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Introduces New Legislation to Kick Off Computer Science Education Week,2018-12-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymember Berman introduced two bills to guide the state’s advancement of computer science education. The new legislation comes as Computer Science Education Week – a national campaign to promote K-12 computer science education – begins.
“Universal and early access to computer science education is critical to providing California’s students with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Too many students don’t even have the opportunity to take computer science courses in California public schools, and this digital divide is often felt the most in low-income communities and school districts.”
In September, the state adopted its first-ever computer science standards. Now, California is considering adopting a Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan (CSSIP). The plan would address broadening the pool of computer science teachers, defining computer science education principles that meet the needs of K-12 students, and ensuring that all students have access to quality computer science courses.
Assembly Bill 20 would create the California Computer Science Coordinator within the California Department of Education, a role needed to oversee the state’s successful implementation of the CSSIP, and Assembly Bill 52 would require the CSSIP to be continually updated to ensure it remains relevant and reflects technological advancements.
“In today’s digitally driven world, technology is woven into the fabric of every company and every job,” said Kara Bush on behalf of the Computing Technology Industry Association, a co-sponsor of the bill. “Every California student deserves to be fully prepared to thrive in the 21st century. Location and socio-economic conditions should not be a barrier – regardless of whether you reside in the Central Valley, South Central LA, or East Palo Alto. All students deserve to be exposed to the same building blocks for success. We are proud to work with Assemblymember Berman to take tangible steps that will provide access to new career opportunities for California students, and create a diverse and skilled employee pipeline that will attract and develop new companies in the Golden State.” 
The Instructional Quality Commission and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction are expected to recommend a draft CSSIP to the State Board of Education in March of next year. The plan is based on recommendations made by an advisory panel earlier this year. The State Board of Education is required to consider adopting the plan on or before July 15, 2019.
“TechNet is proud to co-sponsor Assembly Bill 20 and Assembly Bill 52, and we thank Assemblymember Berman for his continued leadership on computer science education,” said Courtney Jensen, Executive Director for TechNet. “To prepare our students for the jobs of the future, it is essential that computer science must be taught in every California school. The U.S. faces a significant and growing computer science skills gap that is leaving too many of our young people unable to secure the high-paying job opportunities available to them in the innovation economy.”
There are nearly 571,000 open computing jobs nationwide according to Code.org. However, only slightly more than 49,000 students graduated with computer science degrees last year.
Introducing computer science courses at a young age has the potential to close the diversity gap in computer science fields and provide the workforce needed for California and the nation to remain competitive in the global economy. Statistics indicate that young women who take an Advanced Placement computer science course in high school are 10 times as likely to major in computer science in college. African American and Latino students are over seven times more likely.
Assemblymember Berman’s advocacy for computer science education for all California students dates back to his tenure at the Silicon Valley Education Foundation, a non-profit focused on STEM education and closing the achievement gap in Silicon Valley public schools. Earlier this year, Assemblymember Berman introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution 265 designating September 2018 as California Computer Science Education Month, and hosted an education forum in East Palo Alto on closing the computer science gap in K-12 education.

Marc Berman,Sexual Assault Survivors Given More Time for Civil Recourse,2018-09-30,press_release,NA,"Amid the #MeToo movement, California extends the statute of limitations for sexual assault survivors to seek civil damages from assailants.
 
SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 1619, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman, giving adult sexual assault survivors an additional eight years to file a civil case in response to a sexual assault.
“As women and men across the country share their experiences of sexual assault – often years later – it is clear that significant time is needed to recover and overcome the many practical obstacles that prevent sexual assault survivors from civil recourse,” said Assemblymember Berman. “In addition to the physical and emotional trauma caused by a sexual assault, survivors also face substantial expenses due to health care costs, lost wages, and legal fees. I am proud to have authored AB 1619, which extends the statute of limitations so that more sexual assault survivors can seek justice in civil court.​” 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in three women and one in six men have experienced sexual violence. In most cases of sexual assault, adults have a two-year window to file a civil lawsuit. This timeframe is not realistic for a variety of reasons, including recovering physically and mentally from a sexual assault, not knowing that civil remedies are available, or waiting for evidence to be processed or for the outcome of a criminal investigation or trial.
Under the new law, sexual assault survivors will have ten years from the date of a sexual assault or three years from the date of discovery of an illness or injury that resulted from a sexual assault, whichever is later, to commence a civil case.
“The Association of California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (Cal SAFE) would like to extend its sincere gratitude to Governor Brown for signing AB 1619, which increases the statute of limitations for civil claims from two to ten years for adult survivors of sexual assault,” said Kim Walker on behalf of the Association of California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners. “Recovery from sexual assault takes many years. It is not a linear process. Victims experience deep emotional trauma that can manifest as suicide attempts, drug addiction, reckless driving, dropping out of school, school problems from lack of focus and concentration, job performance issues, lack of support from family and friends, and much more. They may not have the personal strength to pursue civil remedies, and sometimes their criminal cases are still pending.​”
AB 1619 was sponsored by the Association of California Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners, which represents the doctors, nurses, and physician assistants who conduct forensic medical examinations for survivors of sexual assault.

Marc Berman,"New Law Combats Child Hunger, Increases Access to School Meals",2018-09-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 3043, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which will improve and increase access to school meals.
 
“Good nutrition and a full stomach are essential for learning in school,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Providing breakfast to all students at no cost and utilizing food trucks to provide nutritious meals are two ways to ensure that California students do not go hungry.”
 
Under the new law, schools will be able to use their cafeteria funds to offer Universal Breakfast, a program that provides a free nutritious breakfast to all students. This law also allows schools to purchase food trucks in order to provide additional points of service for students, which will help expand access to school meals while maintaining nutritional standards.
 
“As a former high school science teacher and coach, I know that all students need a healthy and nutritious breakfast to start the school day the right way,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson. “Students who eat right and exercise will do better in class. This bill lets school districts offer a free breakfast to all students and even lets them serve from food trucks. I want to thank everyone who supported the bill. Let’s start serving breakfast for every student.”
 
According to No Kid Hungry, more than one in five California children live in poverty and over 1.7 million California households with children struggle to put food on the table. School meals are an effective way to combat child hunger and ensure that students are ready to learn. AB 3043 makes necessary changes that will help schools better provide these meals to California students.
 
“Principals and teachers across the country report when students start their day with a healthy meal, they attend more days of school per year, score higher on tests and are more likely to graduate high school. By making California’s school nutrition programs even more robust and more accessible for students across the state, AB 3043 will help ensure more kids have the food they need to thrive in school and beyond,” said No Kid Hungry California Director Kathy Saile. “We appreciate Assemblymember Berman’s leadership on this issue, and we applaud Governor Brown for signing this important bill.”

Marc Berman,"Schools Must Review, Update Suicide Policies Under New Law",2018-09-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 2639, authored by Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) and Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach), aimed at preventing student suicide, the second leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year olds.
 
“Requiring schools to review and update their suicide prevention policies will ensure that schools are continuing to support students’ mental health needs. This is critically important as youth suicide rates continue to rise,” said Assemblymember Berman. “The health and safety of our students is paramount and these policies better equip schools to recognize the warning signs and make the appropriate referrals for help.”
 
Under the new law, schools must review their suicide prevention policies at least every five years and to update them as needed. This bill builds upon Assembly Bill 2246 (O’Donnell), which Governor Brown signed in 2016, requiring schools serving students in grades 7 to 12 to adopt a suicide prevention policy in consultation with school and community stakeholders, mental health professionals, and suicide prevention experts.
 
“With the signature of Governor Brown, AB 2639 takes the student suicide prevention policy efforts of California yet another big step forward,” said Sam Brinton, Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs at The Trevor Project. “Thanks to the never-ending efforts of legislators like Assemblymembers Berman and O’Donnell, this legislation will save young LGBTQ lives as local educational agencies review and improve their policies so that every student has access to a life-saving student suicide prevention policy.” 
 
Students spend roughly 1,000 hours per year in school. In a national survey conducted by the Jason Foundation, students reported that the number one person they would turn to for help for a friend who might be suicidal was a teacher.
 
“Young LGBTQ Californians face disproportionately high risks of suicide, but our teachers and school staff are on the frontlines of awareness and prevention,” said Equality California Executive Director Rick Zbur. “We are deeply grateful to Governor Brown for signing this critical bill, which will help them identify warning signs, assist youth in crisis and protect the well-being of the next generation of Californians.”

Marc Berman,New Law Allows Voters to Track Ballots to Ensure They Are Counted,2018-09-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 2218, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which will allow California voters to track their vote by mail ballots by 2020.
 
“If you can track your online purchase of toilet paper from the time it is shipped to the time it is delivered, you ought to be able to track something in the mail as important as your ballot,” said Assemblymember Berman. “At a time when both participation and confidence in our elections are low, we ought to be using technology that can improve voters’ satisfaction with the voting process. I am proud to have authored AB 2218, which will provide assurance to voters that their ballots are counted and limit the number of ballots that are disqualified due to correctable errors.”
 
In all but one statewide election since 2010, a majority of California voters cast their votes using vote by mail ballots, and as of November 2016, 51% of California voters were registered as permanent vote by mail voters. That number is expected to climb as the California Voter’s Choice Act is implemented.
 
Under this bill, the Secretary of State would be required to develop a tool that allows vote by mail voters to opt in to receive email or text notifications about the status of their ballots. County elections officials would be able to send reminders to voters who have not returned their ballots and quickly contact voters who need to provide additional information – a signature, for example – in order to have their ballots counted.
 
“A vote by mail ballot has been the choice for a majority of California voters for several cycles now, and it continues to grow in popularity,” Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. “Meanwhile, consumers have become accustomed to tracking our e-commerce packages at every step until delivery. We should bring the same level of customer service to voters who choose to vote at home. Developing a statewide vote-by-mail tracking system would improve the voter experience and provide them confidence that their ballots are properly accounted for. AB 2218 will ensure the Secretary of State’s office can access federal funding to make this critical modernization to our elections.”
 
AB 2218 was inspired the Denver Elections Department’s Ballot TRACE (Tracking, Reporting, and Communication Engine) System, which similarly enables voters to track their ballots and allows elections officials to deliver important information about steps voters can take to ensure that their ballots are counted.

Marc Berman,"Governor Okays Texting, Modernizing Communication with Public Benefit Recipients",2018-09-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed legislation authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) to modernize the way families receive information about their CalFresh and California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) benefits. Specifically, Assembly Bill 1957 authorizes county human services agencies to send notices and reminders via computer-generated text message.
“Representing the heart of Silicon Valley, I’ve witnessed how technology can add value and efficiency to people’s lives,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 1957 leverages technology to support our most vulnerable communities by preventing families from losing critical benefits due to outdated and impractical communication methods.”
More than four million Californians – over half of whom are children – rely on CalFresh benefits for food. Similarly, over one million Californians receive financial assistance from CalWORKs for housing, toiletries, and other necessities.
“The housing crisis has left too many Californians without a confidential mailing address where they can receive public benefit notices. Text messaging is becoming an increasingly important tool for communication between county workers and recipients,” said Jessica Bartholow of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, a co-sponsor of the bill. “AB 1957 ensures that, as counties seek to modernize their communication practices, they do so in ways that are compliant with federal consumer laws and privacy best practices.”
Under AB 1957, the California Department of Social Services will work with stakeholders to develop guidelines for counties to effectively implement text messaging as a means to communicate with CalFresh and CalWORKs applicants and recipients.
“Food banks across the state have seen firsthand the need to utilize digital communication technologies to meet the needs of the people we serve,” said Andrew Cheyne, Director of Government Affairs for the California Association of Food Banks, a co-sponsor of the bill. “We are grateful that Assemblymember Berman brought forward AB 1957 to strengthen text messaging options for all Californians, while enhancing privacy protections that are needed more than ever.”

Marc Berman,California Acts to Defend Elections from Cyberattacks,2018-08-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 3075, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), to establish the Office of Elections Cybersecurity (OEC) within the Secretary of State’s office.
“Russia, Iran, and North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated attacks on our elections demand an equally sophisticated response,” said Berman. “AB 3075 will equip state and county elections officials with resources to repel cyber-attacks and counteract misinformation designed to suppress voter turnout. By creating the first Office of Elections Cybersecurity in the country, California is taking the lead to combat nefarious tactics intended to undermine our democracy.” ​
On March 7, 2018, the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee and the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee held a joint informational hearing on cybersecurity and California elections. Expert witnesses emphasized the importance of information sharing and coordination between government agencies as well as developing strategies to counteract false or misleading information that may suppress voter participation or otherwise undermine the integrity of elections.
Under the bill, the OEC would be tasked with these responsibilities in addition to developing best practices for protecting election infrastructure from cyber threats, identifying resources available to state and county elections officials, and advising the Secretary of State on election cybersecurity issues.
Assemblymember Berman and Senator Henry Stern (D-Canoga Park) successfully advocated for $2 million in the California 2018-19 Budget to fund the Office of Elections Cybersecurity.

Marc Berman,Governor Brown Signs Bill to Preserve Health Care for Wildfire Victims,2018-08-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 2941, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), to ensure that victims of wildfires and other natural disasters have continued access to health care.
“With the signing of AB 2941, Californians will never have to worry about losing access to health care during a state of emergency,” said Assemblymember Berman. “I am proud to have authored this critical legislation to preserve health care coverage for residents across the state whose lives are upended by wildfires, floods or other natural disasters.”
Beginning January 1, 2019, health plans and health insurers will be required to provide access to medically necessary health care services to patients who have been displaced by a Governor-declared state of emergency. Under the new law, health plans and health insurers could authorize care to be provided by an out-of-network provider, extend filing deadlines for claims, suspend prescription refill limitations and allow prescriptions to be refilled at an out-of-network pharmacy, relax time limits for referrals, and allow for medical equipment or supplies to be replaced.
“Ensuring patients have continued access to health care services and coverage is critical during a declared emergency, especially for residents who live in rural and remote parts of the state where accessing health care is considerably more difficult,” said Rex Bohn, Chair of the Rural County Representatives of California and Humboldt County Supervisor. “Access to medical care should never be out of reach, regardless of the circumstance. AB 2941 ensures the medical needs of individuals and families impacted by disasters continue to be met so they can recover and start to rebuild their lives.” 
Since June, Governor Brown has declared eight states of emergency in ten counties due to wildfires. In 2017, Governor Brown declared 14 states of emergency in 18 counties due to wildfires that tore through the state destroying homes, threatening critical infrastructure, and displacing over a hundred thousand residents.
“When wildfires cause evacuations or lost homes, California should ensure those impacted continue to have access to health care services during such a state of emergency,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, the statewide health consumer advocacy coalition. “AB 2941 is an important consumer protection that will ensure that those who are displaced due to fires, floods, earthquakes, or other disasters continue to receive vital covered services such as prescription drugs.”
AB 2941 recognizes the importance of consistent health care coverage for patients with chronic conditions as well as those with injuries and illnesses caused directly by wildfires and other natural disasters, and will ensure that they have continued access to medically necessary health care services.

Marc Berman,Ballot Tracking Bill Approved by Legislature,2018-08-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – The Legislature has approved Assembly Bill 2218, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which would enable California voters to track their vote by mail ballots by 2020.
“With more than two-thirds of California voters choosing to vote by mail at this year’s primary election, it is time for the state to better utilize technology to help voters track their vote by mail ballots,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 2218 will give voters greater peace of mind that their ballots are counted, while cutting down on the number of vote by mail voters who are disenfranchised due to correctable errors.”​
In all but one statewide election since 2010, a majority of California voters cast their votes using vote by mail ballots, and as of November 2016, 51% of California voters were registered as permanent vote by mail voters. That number is expected to climb as the California Voter’s Choice Act is implemented.
Under this bill, the Secretary of State would be required to develop a tool that allows vote by mail voters to opt in to receive email or text notifications about the status of their ballots. County elections officials would be able to send reminders to voters who have not returned their ballots and quickly contact voters who need to provide additional information – a signature, for example – in order to have their ballots counted.
AB 2218 was inspired the Denver Elections Department’s Ballot TRACE (Tracking, Reporting, and Communication Engine) System, which similarly enables voters to track their ballots and allows elections officials to deliver important information about steps voters can take to ensure that their ballots are counted.
Governor Brown has until September 30th to act on the bill.

Marc Berman,Office of Elections Cybersecurity Approved by Legislature,2018-08-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today the Legislature approved Assembly Bill 3075, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), to establish the Office of Elections Cybersecurity (OEC) within the Secretary of State’s office.
“Attempts by Russia and other foreign entities to undermine public confidence in our nation’s elections cannot be ignored. AB 3075 is an important step to ensuring that state and county elections officials have the information and the tools necessary to combat cyber-attacks. Given the ongoing and increasingly sophisticated threats posed to our elections systems, it is crucial for California to take all necessary steps to defend our democracy,” said Berman.
On March 7, 2018, the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee and the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee held a joint informational hearing on cybersecurity and California elections. Expert witnesses emphasized the importance of information sharing and coordination between government agencies as well as developing strategies to counteract false or misleading information that may suppress voter participation or otherwise undermine the integrity of elections.
Under the bill, the OEC would be tasked with these responsibilities in addition to developing best practices for protecting election infrastructure from cyber threats, identifying resources available to state and county elections officials, and advising the Secretary of State on election cybersecurity issues.
Assemblymember Berman and Senator Henry Stern (D-Canoga Park) successfully advocated for $2 million in the California 2018-19 Budget to fund the Office of Elections Cybersecurity.
The bill now awaits Governor Brown’s signature.

Marc Berman,Legislature Passes Bill to Preserve Health Care for Wildfire Victims,2018-08-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – The Legislature has unanimously approved Assembly Bill 2941, authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), to ensure that victims of wildfires and other natural disasters have continued access to health care.
“The passage of this bill could not be timelier as wildfires rage throughout our state. Every Californian deserves the assurance that their health care needs will be met during a state of emergency,” said Berman.
Under the bill, health plans and health insurers would be required to provide access to medically necessary health care services to patients who have been displaced by a Governor-declared state of emergency. If signed into the law, health plans and health insurers could authorize care to be provided by an out-of-network provider, extend filing deadlines for claims, suspend prescription refill limitations and allow prescriptions to be refilled at an out-of-network pharmacy, relax time limits for referrals, and allow for medical equipment or supplies to be replaced.
In the last month, Governor Brown has declared six states of emergency in nine counties due to wildfires. In 2017, Governor Brown declared 14 states of emergency in 18 counties due to wildfires that tore through the state destroying homes, threatening critical infrastructure, and displacing over a hundred thousand residents.
AB 2941 recognizes the importance of consistent health care coverage for patients with chronic conditions as well as those with injuries and illnesses caused directly by the wildfires and other natural disasters, and will ensure that they have continued access to medically necessary health care services.
The bill now awaits Governor Brown’s signature.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Bill to Improve Voter File Security,2018-07-16,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed legislation authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) to improve voter file security and combat deceptive information about voting. Assembly Bill 1678 modernizes procedures for secure storage of voter data, protocols for notifying authorities of data breaches, and penalties for distributing misinformation about voting.
“Our voting systems are under constant threat from foreign governments and bad actors, such as Russia. Recent breaches of databases held by third parties have left voter data exposed. In addition, the dissemination of intentionally false information about when and how to vote continues to occur,” said Berman. “While President Trump sides with Russia over America’s intelligence agencies, it is vital for the health of our democracy that we protect voter data and combat tactics that threaten the integrity of our elections.”
AB 1678 provides additional tools for California to combat false election information and ensure that voter data is secure in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.
“Securing voter data and fighting misinformation has never been a more critical mission for our democracy,” Secretary of State Alex Padilla said. “AB 1678 modernizes the security storage procedures campaigns, journalists, and researchers must follow to access voter data. Those with access to voter data have a responsibility to protect it. This legislation will also expand penalties for those who seek to spread false election information.”
“Today’s press conference with President Trump made it clear that the federal government will not be stepping up to defend the integrity of our elections,” said Senator Henry Stern, who co-authored AB 1678. “California voters should rest a bit easier knowing that the state is rolling out the strongest elections security framework in the nation. We moved this as an urgency measure because we needed to make it clear that knowingly spreading misinformation about voter qualifications or voting sites will now be a crime in California.”
AB 1678 received bipartisan support in the Legislature.

Marc Berman,Berman Champions Funding for Youth Suicide Prevention Training,2018-06-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) is pleased to have secured $1.7 million to provide youth suicide prevention training for all school staff and students. Today Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 1808, the education omnibus trailer bill, which appropriates this funding. 
“It is imperative that administrators, teachers, and students have the knowledge, tools, and resources to recognize the warning signs and respond to students who need help. Too many of our communities across California, including in the 24th Assembly District, have been affected by youth suicides. This funding is a critical step in preventing these tragedies by identifying the best online youth suicide prevention training and making it available to schools for free,” said Berman.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that suicide among youth is on the rise and is now the second leading cause of death among those 10 to 24 years of age. In addition, the suicide rate for middle school students is at an all-time high. According to the CDC, suicide is the third leading cause of death among students aged 10 to 14, and more die by suicide than as a result of motor vehicle accidents.
“Too many of our LGBTQ youth are lost each year to suicide,” said Equality California Legislative Manager Jo Michael. “We’re grateful to Assemblymember Berman for leading this effort, and to Governor Brown and the Legislature for making this critical investment and giving our teachers, administrators and school staff the training they need to save lives.”
As youth spend a significant amount of their lives in school, the personnel who interact with them on a daily basis are in a prime position to recognize the warning signs of suicide and make the appropriate referrals for help. In a national survey conducted by the Jason Foundation, students reported that the number one person they would turn to for helping a friend who might be suicidal was a teacher. However, research on school staff preparedness has identified a lack of experience, training, and confidence to appropriately address mental health issues and suicide ideation among students.
“California is leading by example in suicide prevention training by investing $1.7 million to save the lives of youth across the state,” said Sam Brinton, Head of Advocacy and Government Affairs for The Trevor Project. “LGBTQ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their peers. Educators and school staff trained in suicide prevention can save countless lives, regardless of the identity of the student.”
Specifically, the funding would be given as a grant to acquire and disseminate online training in suicide awareness and prevention to all public schools serving students in grades 7 to 12. The training program is required to be evidence-based; be consistent with the model pupil suicide prevention policy developed by the California Department of Education; address the needs of high-risk groups, such as LGBTQ youth; track aggregate, statewide usage; and assess knowledge before and after training is provided in order to measure training outcomes.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Marc Berman and Senator Dr. Richard Pan Gather Local and State Partners Together to Prepare for the 2020 Census,2018-05-22,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO – Members of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census and the Senate Select Committee on the 2020 United States Census gathered today for the first time to discuss the challenging task of ensuring that every California resident is counted in the 2020 Census. Achieving a complete count is critically important to ensuring that California does not lose out on billions of dollars in federal funding for education, healthcare, transportation, and other critical services, as well as the possibility of losing more than one seat in the House of Representatives.
“We need to be sure every Californian is counted because for every person undercounted, California loses $2,000 per year,” said Senator Dr. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), Chair of the Senate Select Committee on the 2020 United States Census. “There will be many challenges in taking on the mammoth task of counting all people living in California, and the groups and organizations represented at this hearing will be instrumental to an accurate census.”
California has historically been difficult to count due to its size and diversity. More than 20 percent of California’s populated areas are considered “hard-to-count” – regions where the self-response rate to the census questionnaire has been low. Federal inaction, a new untested method of response to the census questionnaire, and the addition of a widely-criticized citizenship question will further exacerbate difficulties reaching California’s immigrant and low-income communities.
“There is no one time expenditure that is going to have a higher return on investment than the census,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census. “If we work together, I am very confident that we are going to make sure that every Californian is counted.”
Both select committees are working closely with the Brown Administration and the California Complete Count Committee to bring together essential local and regional partners and to coordinate census outreach efforts.
Watch the hearing online.

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Governor’s Revised Budget Proposal,2018-05-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to Governor Brown’s May Revision to the California 2018-19 Budget:
“As Chair of the Assembly Elections and Redistricting Committee, I am pleased that the May Revision includes roughly $1 million for the Secretary of State’s office to enhance its Cyber Security Program. As we heard from numerous experts at a joint hearing earlier this year, these funds are critical to mitigating cyberthreats that undermine the integrity of our elections.
“However, as Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census, I had hoped that the May Revision would include additional resources for census outreach. Since the January Budget was released, the Trump Administration has added an untested citizenship question to the 2020 Census, which will further exacerbate challenges reaching our hard-to-count population. More funding is needed to ensure every Californian is counted, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Brown Administration to address that need.”

Marc Berman,Trump Census Puts California at Risk,2018-04-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – At a special event held by the Public Policy Institute of California, and attended by hundreds of non-profits and foundation leaders from across California, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on the Census, emphasized why it is imperative that every Californian is counted in the 2020 Census.

“California is a big, bold, beautiful, diverse, complicated state,” said Assemblymember Berman. “We have residents who speak dozens of different languages and come from hundreds of countries, and all in all, make up 39.5 or 40 million unique stories. The census count should be about counting all of those stories and counting all of those people.”
Census data is used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives and to distribute more than $675 billion in federal funding. An undercount would deprive California of its fair share of billions of dollars in federal funds and threaten at least one of the state’s seats in the House of Representatives.
“This is an issue that is going to impact red districts, and it is going to impact blue districts,” Berman said. “Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, there is an incentive to care about this and to really want to make sure that every resident gets counted.”
In the one-on-one conversation with Mark Baldassare, President and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California, Assemblymember Berman noted that federal inaction, the addition of a widely-criticized citizenship question, and the prevalence of historically hard-to-count communities in California threaten a complete and accurate count.
“The task in front of us is more difficult than it has ever been,” said Assemblymember Berman. “We need to go out and identify those trusted messengers in all of those communities and all of these hard-to-count communities across the state and make sure they are reaching out and giving folks the confidence to participate and explaining why it is so important.”
In response to the unique challenges facing California, Governor Brown included $40.3 million in the Fiscal Year 2018-2019 budget for Census outreach. The Governor’s office in conjunction with the California Complete Count Committee is coordinating a series of regional meetings between now and August 2018 to bring together essential local and regional partners and coordinate census outreach efforts. The Assembly and Senate’s recently-established, bipartisan select committees will work closely with the Brown administration, assist with outreach, and hold informational hearings across the state.
Video of the event will be available online, courtesy of the Public Policy Institute of California.

Marc Berman,Palo Alto Resident Honored at Assembly’s Holocaust Remembrance Ceremony,2018-04-16,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) honored Judith Rabbie at the California State Assembly’s 13th Annual Holocaust Remembrance Ceremony. Assembly Concurrent Resolution 207, which passed unanimously today, proclaims April 16, 2018, as Holocaust Remembrance Day.

“At a time of rising intolerance and hatred across the world, it’s more important than ever that we remind ourselves of the atrocities of the past,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Judith’s survival during the Holocaust and her long and full life are a testament to her strength and spirit. It’s a privilege to honor her in the Capitol today.”
Judith Rabbie, a resident of Palo Alto for nearly 40 years, was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1941. At the age of three, Rabbie was hidden by a non-Jewish family for ten months until she was reunited with her mother. Her father was killed on his way to a concentration camp. Together, they remained in Hungary for another 12 years before moving to Switzerland. Rabbie completed her schooling there, earning a Master’s Degree in Chemistry. In 1967, Rabbie moved to Israel to pursue a PhD and met her husband there. They raised their two children in Israel until moving to Palo Alto in 1981. 
Like her mother, Rabbie worked as a chemist. She was the manager at Syntax in Palo Alto for 17 years and worked for several small pharmaceutical companies before retiring in 2008. Today, Rabbie says she works for hugs and kisses from her grandkids. 
Rabbie attended Congregation Beth Jacob in Redwood City for thirty years before moving to Congregation Beth Am in Palo Alto. At Beth Am, Rabbie is organizing an Israel program concentrating on Israel’s culture and people. She also belongs to the Bay Area Hidden Children Group and the Jewish Family and Children’s Services Speakers Bureau, where she speaks to students about the Holocaust. 
When asked by a young student if she felt she had revenge, she replied, “My revenge is that I’m standing here, and I can tell you my story. Hitler didn’t do what he wanted to do. I have two children and beautiful grandchildren, and that’s my revenge. I’m here.”

Marc Berman,Census Citizenship Question Must Be Rejected,2018-03-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood) and Assembly Elections and Redistricting Chair Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) today released the following statement in response to the U.S. Commerce Department seeking to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 Census questionnaire:
“The Trump Administration’s Census question about citizenship undoes almost 70 years of progress. It takes us back to 1950 – the last time the U.S. Census Bureau used such a question – in a cynical attempt to intimidate immigrants and hurt states like California that have made immigrants welcome.
“Our California Attorney General and Secretary of State have made clear that adding a citizenship question to the Census would hurt voter rights. Moreover, it appears this question is being rushed into use without the kind of testing and vetting that the decennial Census so badly needs in order to produce accurate results.
“The White House’s Census meddling is yet another sign that the Trump administration would like to take us back to a past where immigrants, women and racial minorities were discriminated against; where discrimination against the LGBTQ community was not just tolerated, it was the law; before a war on poverty; before voter rights; and before environmental awareness.
“We join with every other leader, in and out of California, who insists on the Trump Administration abandoning this fruitless and harmful questioning.”

Marc Berman,Luisa Buada Named Woman of the Year by Assemblymember Berman,2018-03-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) presented Luisa Buada with the Woman of the Year award in recognition of her public service to the 24th Assembly District. Since 1980, Buada has been instrumental in providing health care to the neediest residents of in San Mateo County and the larger Bay Area region.

From left to right: Assembly Republican Leader Brian Dahle, Assemblymember Marc Berman, Woman of the Year Luisa Buada, Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman, and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.
“It is an honor to recognize Luisa for her extraordinary work in the 24th Assembly District,” said Assemblymember Berman. “For over three decades, Luisa has expanded access to health care to tens of thousands of residents who would not have care otherwise. With limited resources, Luisa is creating healthier communities, one patient at a time.”
The daughter of a Filipino farm worker and a nurse, Buada has been a lifelong advocate for farmworkers' rights and health care for all. As a teenager, she witnessed the poor health conditions of migrant farmworkers while volunteering with the United Farm Workers’ Union alongside Cesar Chavez.
Just out of nursing school, Buada founded a community health center for farmworkers in the Salinas Valley – Clínica Popular del Valle de Salinas. She also founded the Berkeley Primary Access Clinic and was integral in the establishment of LifeLong Medical Care.
As Chief Executive Officer for that last 15 years, Buada revitalized the Ravenswood Family Health Center, which provides critically-needed health care services to predominantly low-income, uninsured, and undocumented residents in East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and North Fair Oaks.
Under her leadership, Ravenswood Family Health Center has grown from 13 employees to over 200 and from a modular building into a 38,300 sq. ft. custom-built facility. Today, Ravenswood Family Health Center offers comprehensive, multigenerational health care, along with dental, optometry, pharmacy, and preventative health services. Ravenswood Family Health Center also connects patients to additional resources that impact one’s health – food, shelter, clothing, special education, and intimate partner violence and parenting support.
In March of 2010, Buada was inducted into the San Mateo County Women’s Hall of Fame. Recently, she was awarded the 2016 Visionary of the Year Award sponsored by The San Francisco Chronicle and the School of Economics and Business Administration at St. Mary’s College as well as the John W. Gardner Exemplary Leadership Award from the American Leadership Forum of Silicon Valley.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Says Our Elections are Secure but State Must Continue to be Vigilant,2018-03-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the Joint Legislative Hearing of the Assembly Elections & Redistricting Committee and the Senate Elections & Constitutional Amendments Committee. Committee members, cybersecurity experts, and elections officials discussed continued efforts by foreign operatives to influence U.S. elections and additional ways to shield California’s voting systems from increasingly sophisticated attacks.
“Our voting systems were not hacked during the 2016 elections, but they are under constant threat,” said Assemblymember Berman, Chair of the Assembly Elections & Redistricting Committee. “Californians can feel confident knowing that we are being vigilant and taking proactive steps to protect our elections from interference.”

Marc Berman,Assemblymembers Berman and O’Donnell Introduce Legislation to Prevent Student Suicide,2018-02-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymembers Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) and Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach) introduced legislation aimed at preventing student suicide, the second leading cause of death among 10 to 24 year olds.
“Schools are on the front lines of suicide prevention,” said Assemblymember Berman. “It is imperative that teachers and all school staff have the tools they need to be trained to recognize the warning signs and respond appropriately. This legislation will support our schools’ efforts to improve suicide awareness and prevent further tragedies.”
AB 2639 would direct the California Department of Education to identify evidence-based, online suicide prevention training programs and provide funding to make the identified training available to school staff and students at all public schools serving students in grades 7 to 12, including charter schools. The training program must address the needs of high-risk groups such as youth bereaved by suicide; youth with disabilities, mental illness, or substance use disorders; youth experiencing homelessness or in foster care; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth.
""LGBTQ youth are at very high risk for suicide, and that risk is magnified even further for young people who are members of one or more additional high-risk communities,"" said Rick Zbur, Executive Director of Equality California. ""This legislation will save young lives by making funding available for training that focuses on high-risk students and intervention strategies so teachers and school staff will know how to help when they see a young person in crisis.""
Students spend roughly 1,000 hours per year in school. Given the amount of time that school staff spend with students, they are in a prime position to recognize the warning signs of suicide. The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention recognizes the unique position of teachers and other school staff in preventing suicide and specifically states that teachers and school counselors should receive suicide prevention training.
“As a parent, a teacher, and as Chair of the Assembly Education Committee, the well-being of our students is always a top priority for me,” Assemblymember O’Donnell said. “This measure is an effort to better equip our teachers and staff to support our students and ensure their safety.”
In 2016, AB 2246 (O’Donnell) was signed into law requiring schools serving students in grades 7 to 12 to adopt a suicide prevention policy. AB 2639 builds upon this legislation and takes the next step in offering schools a convenient way to train school staff at no cost to them.
“As the nation’s leading provider of crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth, The Trevor Project proudly stands with Assemblymembers Berman and O’Donnell to provide the critical next step in California’s leadership in the prevention of suicide,” said Amit Paley, CEO and Executive Director of The Trevor Project.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Selected to Lead 2020 Census Committee,2018-02-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) has been appointed by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) to Chair the Assembly Select Committee on the Census.
“With congressional representation and billions of dollars in federal funding at stake, it is critically important that every resident in California is counted in the 2020 Census,” said Assemblymember Berman. “There are many obstacles to an accurate count – the Census is severely underfunded and already behind schedule due to federal inaction – but we are going to do everything we can to ensure full participation.”
As mandated by the Constitution, the United States Census Bureau conducts a survey of everyone living in the country every ten years. Census data is used to determine the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives and to distribute more than $400 billion in federal funding for healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The California Department of Finance estimates that for every Californian not counted in 2020, state and local governments will lose $1,950 per resident per year.
“As both the most populous state and a “donor” state, California has a lot at stake in ensuring a fair and thorough census,” said Speaker Rendon. “Assemblymember Berman and his committee will work hard to help make that happen.”
Many challenges threaten a complete and accurate count of Californians in the Census. More than 20 percent of California's populated areas are considered ""hard-to-count,” with Los Angeles County having been identified as the most difficult county in the nation to count. Hard-to-count refers to counties where the self-response rate to the census questionnaire has historically been low. At the federal level, preparation for the Census is behind schedule and a lack of funding from Congress has forced the Census Bureau to cancel key preparations, including testing a new and unused method of response. As a result, the federal Government Accountability Office has deemed the Census an “at-risk program.”
In January, Governor Brown allocated $40.3 million to Census outreach in his proposed budget. The Select Committee on the Census will work closely with the Brown administration in preparation for the Census, assist with outreach, collect data, and hold informational hearings across the state on the Census process and engagement.
Other members of the committee include: Assemblymembers Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, Dr. Joaquin Arambula, Sabrina Cervantes, Ed Chau, Philip Chen, Jordan Cunningham, Jacqui Irwin, Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Marie Waldron, and Shirley Weber.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Introduces Bill to Modernize Public Benefit Programs,2018-01-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) introduced legislation to modernize communication between public benefit recipients and county human services agencies. Specifically, Assembly Bill 1957 would give people the option to receive information about the status of their applications, updates about their benefits, and reminders about upcoming appointments electronically.
“Modern technology provides the opportunity to make people’s lives easier and to ensure our government runs more efficiently,” said Assemblymember Berman. “AB 1957 captures this opportunity by improving communication for families on public assistance.”
More than four million Californians – over half of whom are children – rely on CalFresh benefits for food. Similarly, over one million Californians receive financial assistance from the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids program (CalWORKs) for housing, toiletries, and other necessities.
By communicating electronically, county human services agencies have not only increased efficiency, they have also improved outcomes for families in need. In particular, Santa Clara County and others have significantly reduced the number of families who lose benefits and must reapply by providing email, voice, and text options as alternatives to traditional mail.
“AB 1957 is a great opportunity to provide guidance for counties to adopt modern communication processes that will increase programmatic efficiency and client access,” said Sarah Palmer DeFrank with the California Association of Food Banks. “We look forward to working with Assemblymember Berman and his staff this legislative season.” 
Importantly, this bill includes a number of provisions to protect the privacy and rights of those who choose to correspond electronically. Among other things, the bill requires electronic communication and data storage to comply with state security standards and county human services agencies to keep a record of all electronic correspondence.
""As government program delivery is modernized, we want to make sure that privacy and due process rights for applicants are also modernized,” said Jessica Bartholow with Western Center on Law and Poverty, a co-sponsor of the bill. ""We are very appreciative of Assemblymember Berman's leadership in bringing this topic to the Legislature and hopeful for the bill's success.""
AB 1957 will ensure that county human services agencies communicate efficiently with the people they serve while also protecting the privacy and rights of CalFresh and CalWORKs applicants and recipients.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Responds to Governor Brown’s State of the State Address,2018-01-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to Governor Brown’s 16th State of the State address today:
“The theme of Governor Brown’s final State of the State address was sustainability, which epitomizes his tenure as Governor. California has championed policies to combat climate change and protect our natural resources. We have extended Cap-and-Trade, increased renewable energy generation, and grown the number of zero-emission vehicles on our roads. In addition, we have increased our reserves through fiscally prudent budgeting, which will help us weather the next economic downtown and continue to invest in education and other programs critical to the 24th Assembly District and the state. Governor Brown’s commitment to sustainability will have lasting impacts, promising a greener, more prosperous future.”

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Governor's Budget,2018-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the Governor’s budget:
“As Chair of the Assembly Elections & Redistricting Committee, I applaud the Governor for his commitment in this budget to strengthening our democracy, and to fair and effective representation.
“By allocating $134.3 million in state funding to help counties replace aging voting systems, this budget represents an important step forward in ensuring the security, integrity, and accuracy of our elections. Furthermore, updating voting equipment will allow California to modernize the way we conduct elections, giving voters more choices about how, when, and where they cast their ballots.
“I further commend Governor Brown on his proposal to spend $40.3 million on outreach planning for the 2020 Census. The funding will help California’s efforts to encourage full participation in the 2020 Census, which will ensure fair political representation and distribution of funding to California.
“Census data not only determines the state's representation in Congress, but is also used to allocate federal funding for vital programs and services, including Medicare, Medi-Cal, affordable housing, infrastructure, and programs for children. The Governor's budget proposes investing approximately $1 per Californian to protect more than $750 billion in federal funding over the course of a decade.
“California is the largest and the hardest-to-count state in the nation, and there are clear indications that it will be particularly difficult to get a complete and accurate count of all residents in 2020. Not only is the next Census behind schedule and underfunded due to federal inaction, but it faces unique challenges because of the use of new and untested methodology. High levels of mistrust of the federal government will create further obstacles to an accurate count in 2020.
“By preparing now for a robust Census outreach effort, California can help ensure a more accurate and complete count of communities around the state.
“I look forward to working with the Governor on these two new major commitments that, taken together, will enable California to continue its unique leadership in promoting fair and effective representation.”

Marc Berman,"Legislation Authored by Assemblymember Marc Berman to Take Effect on January 1, 2018",2017-12-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) authored ten bills that will go into effect on January 1, 2018. The legislation is related to a variety of issues, including the environment, education, food security, elections, court efficiency, and victims’ rights.
Environment
Assembly Bill 184 extends the use of the Planning for Sea-Level Rise Database, a critical tool needed by local and state governments to coordinate and respond effectively to rising sea levels.
Assembly Bill 669 allows the Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol to continue testing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control technologies, including Driver Assistive Truck Platooning. These green-trucking technologies improve road safety and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Assembly Bill 733 permits local governments to fund climate change adaptation projects using Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts. Providing communities with a financing tool is imperative as drought, flooding, sea-level rise, and wildfires threaten communities across the state.
Assembly Bill 1294 reaffirms California’s commitment to post-consumer recycled plastic by preserving a truth-in-marketing law for plastic food containers. Accurate labeling on plastic food containers is important to both consumers who choose to buy and manufacturers who invest in recycled plastic.
Education
Assembly Bill 868 promotes vocational training opportunities to enhance California’s workforce by eliminating duplicative regulations for community-based nonprofit organizations.
Food Security
Assembly Bill 323 allows County Human Services Agencies to connect families to emergency food resources using a 2-1-1 telephone referral service. Permitting counties to employ this technology ensures that those in need have timely access to reliable information about emergency food providers.
Elections
Assembly Bill 606 modernizes the state voter information guide and directs the Secretary of State to develop a new tool to electronically communicate with voters about upcoming elections – such as important dates and deadlines.
Assembly Bill 1367 strengthens the initiative process by making it a crime for a supervisor or employer to direct or permit a signature gatherer to falsely represent an initiative, referendum, or recall petition. Previously, only signature gatherers could be penalized, even in cases when they mislead or misinform voters as a result of poor training or at the direction of a supervisor or employer.
Court Efficiency
Assembly Bill 644 furthers California’s effort to make legal proceedings more efficient.
Assembly Bill 976 modernizes California’s court electronic-filing and service process.
Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights
Assemblymember Marc Berman also joint-authored Assembly Bill 1312 with Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher. The Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights provides victims with clarity about their rights as a result of stronger notification requirements from law enforcement and health professionals, codifies new rights such as the right to free contraception, and establishes minimum preservation standards for rape kits.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Bill to Crack Down on Efforts to Mislead Voters,2017-10-16,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Sunday night, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) to curb deceptive signature-gathering practices. Assembly Bill 1367 extends criminal penalties to any individual, company, or organization that directs or allows a signature gatherer to misrepresent an initiative, referenda, or recall petition.
“There is an enormous loophole in existing law that allows companies and organizations to pass the buck to their signature gatherers and avoid taking responsibility for misleading information and outright lies told to gain someone’s signature,” said Berman. “Holding employers accountable will help put an end to dishonest signature-gathering tactics, which erode public trust and undermine the initiative process.”
Under existing law, a signature gatherer may be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment, even in cases when a signature gatherer misled or misinformed voters at the direction of a supervisor or employer. AB 1367 brings parity to the industry by ensuring that consequences for bad actors may be equitably applied.
AB 1367 enjoyed bipartisan support in the Legislature.

Marc Berman,Governor Brown Signs Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights,2017-10-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Governor Brown signed the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, joint authored by Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher (D-San Diego) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto).
“I am proud to be a joint author of AB 1312, the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights,” said Assemblymember Berman. “By enacting this critical legislation, our state has made a commitment to support and protect survivors first and foremost.”​
AB 1312 establishes and expands preservation standards for rape kits, strengthen requirements of law enforcement and medical providers to notify victims of their rights, and codify new guarantees such as the right to emergency contraception and a shower after a forensic exam.
Rise successfully crafted and advocated for the federal Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights signed by President Obama in 2016. Since then, Idaho, Maryland, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, Virginia, and now California, have enacted their own bill of rights.
“Our first course of action as an organization was to pass the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights on the federal level so we could provide a model that other states could adopt. Our theory of change is that hope is contagious – and we have already seen so many states commit to joining this movement and introduce their own Survivors’ Bill of Rights,” said Amanda Nguyen, the founder of Rise, sexual assault survivor, and California native. “For rape survivors like myself, these civil rights in California mean the difference between justice or lost justice. California survivors must have equal rights under the law. With the support from state legislators, we can help pass new laws that will end these injustices and protect the 2 million rape survivors in California.”
According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, an additional 5.6 million women and three million men have been victims of sexual violence other than rape in California. 
""I navigated a broken system after my assault. I'm in this fight because this is the only form of justice from our system that I will ever see. AB 1312 becoming law isn't just a legislative victory; this is a personal victory for every survivor in California,"" said Jennifer Li, the California State Director for Rise. ""To all the current and future survivors: this bill was written for us, by us. With the support from amazing state legislators like Assemblymembers Berman and Gonzalez-Fletcher, we can pass new laws that protect us and allow us a better shot at justice.The signing of this bill restored my faith in our legislative process, and in our democracy. We have a voice. We can change the system. To all the current and future survivors: you are not alone. We did this for you. We did this so you wouldn't have to navigate the system alone. We are always with you, we will always fight for you, and now, the State of California is with you too.""
AB 1312 was co-authored by Assemblymembers Caballero, E. Garcia, C. Garcia, and Low and Senators Atkins and Skinner. It received unanimous support in both houses of the California State Legislature.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Bill to Help Communities Adapt to Climate Change,2017-10-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed a bill by Assemblymember Berman (D-Palo Alto) that provides communities with a financing tool to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change. Assembly Bill 733 allows local governments to fund climate change adaptation efforts using Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts (EIFDs).
“As wildfires blaze rampantly throughout the state, it is clear that climate change is an immediate threat,” said Berman. “As communities begin to rebuild, and as others look to become more resilient, AB 733 provides a critical funding tool to address infrastructure impacted by or vulnerable to climate change.”
Local governments currently use EIFDs to finance public facilities and other projects of communitywide significance. AB 733 allows cities, counties, and special districts to use EIFDs as a financing tool to invest in infrastructure such as highways and bridges, levees, and sewage treatment plants that are at risk due to the impacts of climate change. Such impacts include, but are not limited to, higher average temperatures, decreased air and water quality, the spread of infectious and vector-borne diseases or other public health impacts, extreme weather events, sea level rise, flooding, heat waves, wildfires, and drought.
“Special districts are at the forefront of tackling their communities’ unique climate mitigation and adaptation needs,” said Neil McCormick, CEO of the California Special Districts Association. “AB 733 (Berman) provides local flexibility by ensuring that local governments have an additional, and much needed, funding option to help address the diverse impacts of climate change.”
AB 733 received bipartisan support in the Legislature and was co-authored by Senator Henry Stern.

Marc Berman,Berman’s Bill Advancing Green Trucking Technologies Signed into Law,2017-10-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed a bill by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) that will allow for continued testing of green trucking technologies. Assembly Bill 669 reauthorizes the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), in coordination with the California Highway Patrol (CHP), to test Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) technologies, including Driver Assistive Truck Platooning.
“AB 669 continues the state’s recognition that technology can simultaneously better the lives of Californians and protect the environment,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Platooning will make our roads safer, improve traffic conditions, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
With a driver present and in control, CACC technologies allow trucks to safely follow each other with less than 100 feet between vehicles by syncing acceleration and braking. As a result of this coordination, platooning enhances safety and lessens traffic.
Additionally, Caltrans reported that CACC technologies can reduce fuel consumption by 10 to 15 percent. This finding is consistent with independent testing by the North American Council for Freight Efficiency which found that platooning could lead to 4.5% fuel savings for the lead truck and 10% fuel savings for the following truck. The good’s movement sector accounts for half the state’s diesel consumption, meaning fuel savings will have a significant, positive impact on air quality.
""Thanks to Assemblymember Berman's leadership and the support of CalTrans and the CHP, AB 669 will enable continued on-road testing of truck platooning technology in California, thereby making possible greater safety and efficiency benefits for trucks operating on our roadways,"" said Steve Boyd, Co-Founder & Vice President of External Affairs at Peloton Technology. 
AB 669 provides Caltrans an additional two years to build upon their current findings and to ensure safe deployment of CACC technologies. Without this legislation, Caltrans’ authorization to test CACC technologies would have ended January 1, 2018.

Marc Berman,Governor Brown Signs Bill to Preserve the Sea Level Rise Database,2017-09-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed a bill by Assemblymember Berman (D-Palo Alto) that reaffirms California’s commitment to preparing for and adapting to sea level rise. Assembly Bill 184 extends the Planning for Sea Level Rise Database to January 1, 2023.
“Two-thirds of Californians inhabit coastal regions, which means sea level rise will have a catastrophic impact on coastal communities, infrastructure, and the economy if left unaddressed,” said Berman. “In San Mateo County alone, nearly $40 billion worth of land is at risk of long-term flooding and erosion caused by sea level rise. AB 184 preserves a critical tool that is needed to provide an educated, coordinated, and effective response to sea level rise.”
Under the law, several state agencies as well as ports, airports, and utilities located along the coast and in the San Francisco Bay Area are required to report sea level rise planning information to the Natural Resources Agency biannually, including studies, models, maps, cost-benefit analyses, vulnerability assessments, and updates regarding adaptation projects. Collecting and making this data available is vital to our state’s ability to overcome challenges presented by sea level rise.
“When we see the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma we know that we must plan for more intense storm events and sea level rise in response to climate change,” said Jay Ziegler, Policy Director for The Nature Conservancy. “The Nature Conservancy supports Assemblymember Berman’s leadership – and AB 184 - with an eye to more effective solutions to rising sea levels that protect both people and our environment.”
The Planning for Sea Level Rise database was established by AB 2516 in 2014. Without this legislation, the database would have been repealed on January 1, 2018.
Assemblymembers Chiu, Cunningham, Mullin, Stone, Ting, and Gonzalez Fletcher as well as Senators Hertzberg and Hill are co-authors of AB 184.

Marc Berman,Governor Signs Bill Easing Path for Community Nonprofits like JobTrain to Provide Vocational Training,2017-09-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Saturday, Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill 868 by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), which will make it easier for nonprofit community-based organizations to provide critically needed job-training services to those most in need. 
“Nonprofit community-based organizations, such as JobTrain in Menlo Park, provide essential job-skills training that grow the workforce and strengthen the economy,” said Berman. “AB 868 creates a more straightforward path for these organizations to continue serving their communities.”
AB 868 will exempt nonprofit community-based organizations from regulations by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education if they meet certain criteria. For example, an organization must be a registered nonprofit with programs on the Eligible Training Provider List, must not offer degrees or programs that lead to licensure, and must not otherwise be subject to oversight by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education. This legislation is needed for organizations to be listed on the Eligible Training Provider List, a requirement to serve individuals who receive federal workforce funding. Importantly, AB 868 also includes oversight requirements, which exempt organizations must comply with in order to ensure accountability and to protect students.
“AB 868 will allow our skills-training programs to be visible on the Eligible Training Provider List for those seeking employment training,” said Steven Schmidbauer, Interim President and CEO of Menlo Park based JobTrain. “Making more training programs accessible to people who cannot otherwise hope to make a livable wage to support their families, helps not only these individuals but everyone, as these jobs can be in construction, healthcare, and other fields that positively serve our local communities.”
JobTrain is a 52 year-old nonprofit organization, founded to provide low-income individuals in the Bay Area with vocational training and career development.
AB 868 received unanimous, bipartisan support in the Legislature.

Marc Berman,Berman Responds to Assembly Passage of Housing Package,2017-09-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the passage of legislation in the California State Assembly aimed at tackling California’s housing crisis: 
California is in the depth of a housing crisis that’s impacting our friends, our neighborhoods, and our families. Housing costs are astronomical in the 24th Assembly District. Homes in once middle-class neighborhoods now sell for millions of dollars, and limited supply keep costs rising. There simply aren’t enough homes to meet demand, and it’s tearing apart the socio-economic diversity of our communities. To the commuters who desire to live in the communities they work in, to the young professionals who aspire to be homeowners, and to the parents working hard to keep a roof over their families’ heads - this package of bills is a down payment on addressing the housing crisis plaguing our state.

Marc Berman,Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Awaits Action from Governor,2017-09-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, the California State Legislature voted unanimously to adopt a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights. Assembly Bill 1312, joint authored by Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez-Fletcher (D-San Diego) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto), now awaits Governor Jerry Brown’s signature.
“California is well on its way to making a longstanding commitment to survivors that we support them and that we will protect their rights first and foremost,” said Berman. “Our criminal justice system cannot continue to be so difficult and painful to navigate that survivors choose not to report their assault or do not receive the treatment and services they need.”
Among other things, AB 1312 establishes minimum preservation standards for rape kits, strengthens requirements of law enforcement and medical providers to notify victims of their rights, and codifies new rights such as the right to contraception at no cost to the victim and the right to shower or bathe at a medical facility after a forensic examination.
If signed, California will become the ninth state to enact a statutory bill of rights for sexual assault survivors, following Idaho, Maryland, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia as well as a federal bill of rights signed by President Obama in 2016. AB 1312 is sponsored by Rise, the organization responsible for successfully crafting and advocating for sexual assault survivors’ bills of rights around the country.
“Our first course of action as an organization was to pass the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights on the federal level so we could provide a model that other states could adopt. Our theory of change is that hope is contagious – and we have already seen so many states commit to joining this movement and introduce their own Survivors’ Bill of Rights,” said Nguyen, the founder of Rise, sexual assault survivor, and California native. “For rape survivors like myself, these civil rights in California mean the difference between justice or lost justice. California survivors must have equal rights under the law. With the support from state legislators, we can help pass new laws that will end these injustices and protect the 2 million rape survivors in California.”
AB 1312 is co-authored byAssemblymembers Caballero, E. Garcia, C. Garcia, and Low as well as Senators Atkins and Skinner. It received unanimous, bipartisan support in both houses of the California State Legislature. Governor Brown has until October 15, 2017 to sign the measure.

Marc Berman,"Berman and Colleagues Discuss Future of California Master Plan with UC, CSU, CCC and AICCU Leaders",2017-08-31,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) convened the first hearing of the Assembly Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Janet Napolitano, President of the University of California, Dr. Joseph I. Castro, President of California State University, Fresno, Eloy Ortiz Oakley, Chancellor of the California Community Colleges, Kristen Soares, President of the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities, and Jennifer Kuhn, Deputy Legislative Analyst of the Legislative Analyst’s Office provided the committee with an overview and status of higher education in California.
“Our systems of higher education are envied and emulated throughout the nation, and are critically important to both the upward economic mobility of hundreds of thousands of Californians as well as the state’s economic vitality as the 6th largest economy in the world,” said Berman. “We owe much of this success to the 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education, which has served us well for the last 57 years, and we owe it to both current and future generations to make sure that the Master Plan is updated so that it benefits students and the state for another 50 years.”
The California Master Plan was written in 1960 and has guided the state’s higher education policy during the ensuing decades. Much has changed since the visionary plan was written – population growth, increased diversity, technological advancement, and new leading industries have altered the needs of students, changed the field of education itself, and boosted the demand for higher education.
The Select Committee was established in March 2017. Today’s hearing was the first step in a multi-year endeavor to ensure that the California Master Plan reflects students’ needs in the 21st century so that all students receive the skills they need to succeed.
“I am very encouraged by the level of engagement from my colleagues, the leaders of the higher education institutions, faculty, students, and other stakeholders. I look forward to working with all parties as we conduct a thorough review of the Master Plan. 57 years ago the state made a promise to its students to provide accessible, affordable, and high quality higher education. California must keep its promise,” said Berman.
The Assemblymembers on the Select Committee are Marc Berman (Chair), Dr. Joaquin Arambula, Catharine B. Baker, Autumn R. Burke, Phillip Chen, Susan Talamantes Eggman, Jacqui Irwin, Kevin Kiley, Evan Low, Jose Medina (Chair, Assembly Higher Education Committee), and Shirley N. Weber.

Marc Berman,Governor Brown Signs Bill by Assemblymember Berman to Fight Food Insecurity,2017-07-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Governor Brown signed a bill by Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) to connect families to nutrition assistance programs. Assembly Bill 323 will allow counties to connect CalFresh applicants to emergency food providers through a referral to 2-1-1 services.
“Millions of Californians rely on CalFresh to meet their basic nutritional needs, so it is imperative that they have timely access to emergency food aid,” said Berman. “AB 323 takes a meaningful step towards curbing hunger by employing technology to immediately refer individuals and families to reliable food providers.”
2-1-1 is a free phone number and online database that connects Californians to health and human service programs, joblessness support and disaster response information in their communities. As a best practice, eleven counties utilize 2-1-1 referrals to provide up-to-date information, around-the-clock and in 150 languages. Under existing law, County Human Services Agencies are only required to maintain a physical list of emergency food providers and distribute it upon request.
“When a child goes hungry because there isn't a program that serves them, it is a disgrace. When they go hungry because their family doesn't know about the programs that serve them, it is an insult,” says Jessica Bartholow, Policy Advocate with the Western Center on Law and Poverty, the bill's sponsor. “AB 323 will help prevent the insult of avoidable hunger among children by ensuring that CalFresh applicant families with children know about summer lunch, school meals and other programs to prevent child hunger while their CalFresh application is pending.”
It can take up to 30 days for a CalFresh application to be reviewed and approved. This waiting period can be detrimental to families, and particularly to children who are more likely to incur development impairments that limit their physical, intellectual, and emotional growth as a result of hunger.

Marc Berman,Berman Supports Passage of Bills to Extend Cap-and-Trade and Address Air Quality,2017-07-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – In response to the Legislature approving and sending to the Governor AB 398 (E. Garcia) and AB 617 (C. Garcia), Assemblymember Berman issued the following statement:
As the Trump Administration abdicates its responsibility as a global leader in combating climate change, it is paramount that California reaffirms its commitment to protecting the environment. The benefits of AB 398, which extends California’s cap-and-trade program, and its companion bill to reduce air pollutants, AB 617, will be felt for years to come. Environmentalists and businesses alike recognize that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air and water quality will boost California’s economic competitiveness, protect our precious resources, and increase people’s quality of life — now and in the future.
This legislation is not perfect, and includes some elements that I do not personally support. But when it comes to our climate, we do not have the luxury of letting the perfect be the enemy of the very good. These bills represent a compromise that was balanced enough to achieve a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, and strong enough to represent a significant step forward. I’m proud to have voted for these important pieces of legislation so future generations can enjoy a vibrant and healthy California.
AB 398 extends, until December 31, 2030, the Air Resources Board’s cap-and-trade program authorization, which allows the Air Resources Board to establish a market-based declining annual aggregate emissions limit for sources that emit greenhouse gases. AB 398 makes various changes to the existing cap-and-trade program, including requiring the Air Resources Board to develop ways to increase offset projects with direct environmental benefits in California and requires 50 percent of offset projects to be in California. Under AB 398, the Legislative Analyst’s Office will annually report to the Legislature on the economic impacts and benefits of greenhouse gas reduction efforts.
AB 617 addresses air quality and pollution control issues in a series of measures that includes increasing penalties against violators of air quality regulations. It also requires the retrofit of air pollution control devices at industrial facilities that are part of the cap-and-trade program using the best available retrofit control technology.

Marc Berman,Berman Secures Funding to Combat Flooding in Pescadero,2017-06-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) is pleased to announce that Governor Brown signed the 2017-18 budget today, which allocates $4 million from the General Fund to the Butano Channel Restoration and Resiliency Project in coastal San Mateo County.
“This funding will directly impact constituents in the 24th Assembly District by addressing annual flooding that, due to decades of sediment build-up in the marsh, shuts down the main road into Pescadero after even the smallest rainfall,” said Berman.
Sediment accumulation has filled the historic channel of Butano Creek so that connectivity of Butano Creek through the Butano Marsh to the Pescadero lagoon no longer exists. The project will reestablish 8,000 feet of the historic channel, remove 45,000 cubic yards of sediment, and restore degraded marsh habitat. 
""We are incredibly grateful to Assemblymember Berman, Assemblymember Mullin, and Senator Hill for their support. This budget will give critically endangered salmon a chance to thrive while also reducing the chronic flooding of the main access road to the rural community of Pescadero. It's a genuine win-win,"" said Kellyx Nelson, Executive Director of the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District.

Marc Berman,Berman Expresses Support for California Budget,2017-06-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to passage of the 2017-18 state budget:
Today the Legislature approved a budget that is a strong reflection of California’s values and priorities. This budget allocates funds for critical transportation and infrastructure projects, increases Prop 98 education funding by $3.2 billion and increases enrollment on our UC and CSU campuses for California students, and expands the Earned-Income Tax Credit, all of which will strengthen our communities and our economy.
I’m particularly excited that we were able to secure funding for two computer science initiatives – the development of both computer science education standards and a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel – which will encourage and support schools to expand and diversify access to computer science education so that students gain the skills they need for good-paying jobs in the 21st Century Economy.
The budget also includes $4 million for San Mateo County Resource Conservation District’s Butano Channel Restoration and Resiliency Project. This funding will directly impact constituents in the 24th Assembly District by addressing annual flooding that shuts down the main road into Pescadero after even the smallest rainfall due to decades of sediment build-up in the marsh.
This is also a fiscally prudent budget. By increasing our Regular Reserve by $0.8 billion and our Rainy Day Fund by $1.8 billion, California now has the largest reserves in history and is better prepared to weather the next economic downturn. 
As strong as this budget is, we were unable to address all of the challenges we face. For example, the budget does not address housing affordability that is desperately needed in the 24th Assembly District, and does not extend California’s Cap and Trade program to combat climate change. While we still have plenty of work to do, today’s approved budget addresses some of the real challenges facing my constituents and all Californians.

I’m relieved that Secretary Chao will approve funding for the Caltrain Electrification project.

Marc Berman,California Senate and Assembly Elections Chairs Dubious of Trump's Recent Order on Election Integrity,2017-05-12,press_release,NA,"Trump’s latest attempt to prop up ""Kangaroo Commission"" deeply concerning to security of Californians' voting rights, say Berman and Stern
SACRAMENTO – Today, Chairs of the Senate and Assembly Elections Committees, State Senator Henry Stern (D-Canoga Park) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) issued a joint statement condemning President Trump’s latest Executive Order announcing a commission to investigate voter fraud. Meanwhile Trump’s own Administration is under active FBI investigation.
It's our job to protect Californians' constitutional right to vote, free and unfettered. What other states do--with discriminatory voter ID laws and other voter suppression tactics--is unfortunately out of our hands. But while Donald's Kangaroo Commission on ""Election Integrity"" pursues its witch hunt for fraud that only exists in the White House itself, we'll make sure that Californians' voting rights remain secure.
California has made major strides in recent years to increase voter participation, and Stern and Berman are advancing numerous measures this year to further enhance secure access to the ballot in underrepresented communities, especially for the next generation of young voters, where turnout remains a persistent challenge.

Marc Berman,Berman Releases Statement on Historic Transportation Package,2017-04-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Berman (D-Palo Alto) released the following statement in response to the passage of Senate Bill 1, California’s landmark transportation package.
Tonight I voted yes on Senate Bill 1 to raise an additional $5.2 billion a year to repair California’s crumbling transportation infrastructure.
One of the fundamental roles of government is to build and maintain the critical infrastructure assets our communities need to function and thrive. Yet for a generation, California has fallen further and further behind in maintaining the condition of our roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems.
California’s roads are in a pitiful state. I first realized this almost ten years ago, when I was driving my frail grandmother from her home to my parent’s house for dinner. While I never really noticed the poor quality of the streets, I did notice that my grandmother was clearly uncomfortable every time the car was jostled by a pothole or dip in the road.
That led me to serve on Palo Alto’s Infrastructure Blue Ribbon Commission, and later on the Palo Alto City Council’s Infrastructure Committee, leading the effort to increase investments in the community’s roads and streets. These funds have made a difference; by 2019, Palo Alto will have some of the best roads and streets in the Bay Area.
One of my highest priorities in running for State Assembly was to fix our transportation infrastructure. Today we approved the first major investment in over 22 years. Is the bill perfect? No – it’s not. But we can no longer afford to let the perfect be the enemy of the very good. The bill takes a pay-as-you-go approach, rather than incurring debt. It will double spending to repair our crumbling city and county roads. Over the next decade, it will provide billions of dollars for public transit, and hundreds of millions of dollars for bicycle and pedestrian transportation projects. And it will provide the resources needed to begin fixing our pothole-filled highways.
Everyone recognizes the need to improve our crumbling roads, even if few people want to pay for it. We cannot continue to avoid making difficult but necessary decisions today. We have too much work to do to make sure future generations of Californians are set up for success.
Senate Bill 1 passed out of the California State Assembly on a 54-26 vote. The bill is accompanied by Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 which was also approved by the Legislature earlier today. Senate Bill 1 awaits Governor Brown’s signature.

Marc Berman,Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Passed First Hurdle in the California Legislature,2017-03-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – AB 1312, the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, a measure joint authored by Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez-Fletcher (D-San Diego) and Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) received unanimous, bipartisan support in the Assembly Public Safety Committee this morning on a 7-0 vote.
“It should never be the case where the pain of the initial sexual assault is matched by the ordeal survivors go through navigating the criminal justice process,” Assemblymember Berman said. “I believe our state needs to make a longstanding commitment that, during one of the most difficult times in a survivor’s life, the criminal justice system will protect their rights first and foremost.”
Among other things, AB 1312 establishes minimum preservation standards for rape kits, strengthens requirements of law enforcement and medical providers to notify victims of their rights, and codifies new rights such as the right to contraception at no cost to the victim and the right to shower or bathe at a medical facility after a forensic examination.
AB 1312 follows bipartisan legislation unanimously supported and signed into law by President Obama in 2016. The Federal Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights was courageously crafted and advocated for by Amanda Nguyen, a California native, sexual assault survivor, and founder of Rise, an organization dedicated to enacting victims’ bill of rights in statehouses throughout the country. Nguyen and her team at Rise were instrumental in crafting AB 1312.
“Our first course of action as an organization was to pass the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights on the federal level so we could provide a model that other states could adopt. Our theory of change is that hope is contagious – and we have already seen so many states commit to joining this movement and introduce their own Survivors’ Bill of Rights,” said Nguyen. “For rape survivors like myself, these civil rights in California mean the difference between justice or lost justice. California survivors must have equal rights under the law. With the support from state legislators, we can help pass new laws that will end these injustices and protect the 2 million rape survivors in California.”
Today, California moved a step closer to ensuring justice is served for sexual assault survivors. AB 1312 now heads to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Honors Rita Mancera as Woman of the Year,2017-03-06,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO – On Monday, Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) presented Rita Mancera with the Woman of the Year Award in recognition of her public service to the San Mateo County South Coast. Mancera is the Executive Director of Puente de la Costa Sur (Puente), a community resource center in Pescadero, California, that serves mostly immigrant and low-income agricultural workers.
""It is an honor to pay tribute to Rita's exceptional work in the 24th Assembly District. Rita has spent the last decade nurturing a stronger, healthier community through in-person, comprehensive services for residents and families that are some of the hardest working yet the least compensated in my district,"" said Berman. ""Having visited the Puente offices in Pescadero, it's clear that Rita and her staff are doing a great deal of good with limited resources, and this work will be even more critical in the coming years.""
Mancera joined Puente in 2006 as a volunteer shortly after immigrating to California from Mexico. Since then, she has served as the nonprofit’s Community Builder, Program Director, and Deputy Executive Director. In addition to her role at Puente, she is also paralegal, a Board of Immigration Appeals accredited legal worker, a notary public and a Zumba instructor.
An indispensable asset to Puente, Mancera has helped the organization make the most of limited resources and become the vibrant entity it is today. In 2006, Puente was a three-member team with an operating budget less than $200,000. Today, Puente employs 26 full and part-time staff, has an operating budget over $2 million, and offers 40+ programs related to health and wellness, immigration and citizenship, workforce training, education and youth leadership and development.

I am honored that Speaker Rendon has appointed me to Chair the newly established Select Committee on the Master Plan for Higher Education in California,” said Assemblymember Berman. “Nearly sixty years ago, our state developed a visionary plan for the future of higher education, known as the Master Plan. However, much has changed in California during the ensuing decades – population growth, increased diversity, a change in leading industries and their need for talent, as well as in the field of education itself. My goal for the Select Committee is to hold hearings throughout the state to conduct a thorough legislative review to ensure that we have a Master Plan for the next 60 years, and to again promise California’s students who work hard and achieve in high school an accessible, affordable, high quality education.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Responds to Bomb Threat in Palo Alto,2017-02-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-24) has released the following statement in response to a bomb threat made to the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center in Palo Alto:
I am saddened and deeply troubled that the Oshman Family Jewish Community Center in Palo Alto received a bomb threat yesterday. This intolerable incident was not an isolated event, but one of a number of anti-Semitic actions nationwide. Twenty bomb threats were made to Jewish institutions yesterday alone, bringing the total number of threats to 90 since the beginning of the year. In addition, earlier in 2017, a dozen swastikas were drawn on buildings and street signs in Palo Alto and on Stanford University's campus. As a nation founded on the principle of religious freedom, threats against a specific religious community should make us all feel vulnerable. I call on the United States Department of Justice to take every step necessary to investigate the threats that have occurred and prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.

Marc Berman,Assemblymember Berman Responds to President Trump’s Executive Orders on Immigration,2017-01-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Marc Berman (D-Palo Alto) today issued the following statement after President Trump issued several executive orders related to immigration:
President Trump’s executive orders targeting immigrants and turning away refugees from war-torn countries is a violation of basic human rights and disregards the principles upon which our country was founded. I am committed to protecting all Californians from this gross federal overreach.
My own family is only alive and thriving today because the United States didn’t turn us away or build a wall to keep us out in our time of need. My maternal grandmother’s family escaped the Warsaw Ghetto and my maternal grandfather’s family fled Nazi Germany the day Hitler came to power. My father came to America after working with other student activists in South Africa to oppose Apartheid, running afoul of the nationalist government. In President Trump’s America, there wouldn’t have been a place for us and so many others who have gone on to discover medical and scientific breakthroughs, start businesses, fight to defend democracy, and create the art, music, and literature that make the United States the envy of the world.
We all have an immigrant story — even President Trump. Whether yours is a few hundred years old or only a few months, we must not lose sight of our nation’s history as a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution, war, poverty, and famine in search of a better life and the American dream. America’s story is not one of ‘we got here first and now you’re on your own,’ it’s one of ‘our families reached the land of the free and now it’s our turn to help protect you and lift you up, because when you rise, we all rise.'

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Releases Statement on Pausing AB 298,2025-04-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) released the following statement as she commits to taking the time needed to deliver real relief for California families. Earlier this month, AB 298 unveiled that California families are putting off over $700 million worth of essential healthcare for their children due to the burden imposed by costs.
 
“I’m excited to continue moving AB 298 later this session. It’s clear that this bill provides a real win for families facing burdensome out-of-pocket health costs for their children at a time when every dollar counts. In the fourth-largest economy, no family should be putting off essential pediatric care because of the cost of co-pays. As part of my commitment to crafting the best policy possible, I will be continuing to work on this bill to ensure we deliver the most impactful health outcomes for our youth while mitigating costs to consumers.”
“I look forward to collaborating with advocates and the Californians who have been at the forefront of these issues to craft the best possible policy for California children and families,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
 
The bill can be expected to be heard next in 2026.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s Reproductive Care Bill Passes the Assembly Floor,2025-04-21,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s (D-Oakland) AB 40 passed the Assembly Floor with an urgency clause, allowing the provisions of the bill to go into effect immediately upon enactment. AB 40, the Protecting Pregnant Patients Act, would clarify in California state statute that abortion care is an emergency service, ensuring that no one in California would be turned away from care when they need it most.
“AB 40 simply clarifies the state law defining emergency services includes reproductive health services as necessary to relieve an emergency medical condition including abortion… Unfortunately, there have been instances where parents in the middle of a miscarriage or other pregnancy-related emergency have been turned away from an emergency room and told to go to another facility. This bill is a simple clarification of law,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta on the Assembly Floor.
“Abortion care is healthcare, plain and simple. It’s not up for debate when someone is bleeding or in pain or facing life-threatening pregnancy complications. It’s a medical necessity. Every second counts in an emergency. No one should have to beg for the care they need, especially in a moment of crisis,” said Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo on the Assembly Floor in support of the bill.
The bill will be heard next in the Senate Health Committee.
Full release from introduction.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces the California Community Reinvestment Act of 2025 to Support Historically Neglected and Wildfire-Impacted Communities,2025-04-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland) has introduced AB 801, the California Community Reinvestment Act of 2025, to align leading modern mortgage lenders, state‑chartered banks, credit unions, and fintech firms to reinvest in the neighborhoods they serve as traditional banks have for half a century. Designed to narrow the racial wealth gap, address statewide funding gaps, and expand access to affordable housing, the legislation sets clear accountability measures for financial institutions.
""California has an opportunity to ensure that leading mortgage lenders are reinvesting into the communities they serve, including low-income communities, communities of color, and wildfire-impacted communities,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland). “I'm proud to lead this California Legislative Black Caucus priority bill, recognizing that the mortgage lending landscape has changed significantly in the last 50 years. AB 801 seeks to combat the racial wealth gap, expand access to affordable housing, and focus on accountability of our financial institutions to ensure they are investing in communities and community programs to help Californians. It is time for California to prioritize our historically neglected communities. I'm grateful for the far-reaching support AB 801 has received so far.""
AB 801 would bring California among the ranks of states like New York, Massachusetts, and most recently, Illinois, which have built upon the federal Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to address its race-neutral limitations and inconsistent enforcement, particularly under the Trump administrations. Since 1977 ‘nonbank’ mortgage lending has boomed and they now comprise a majority of US mortgage lending, this bill would broaden Community Reinvestment Act requirements to better reflect our modern financial institution landscape.
Additionally, recognizing the urgency of recovery in communities hit hard by recent wildfires, the bill also includes measures to stabilize these in-need communities. This is of increased significance for communities such as Altadena which have been hit by both historic redlining and recent wildfires.
“California has a chance to set a new standard in financial equity. With attacks and cuts by the Trump administration on the Department of Housing and Urban Development, potential weakening enforcement of the federal Community Reinvestment Act, and the gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, state-level action is essential,” said Paulina Gonzalez‑Brito, CEO of Rise Economy, a co-sponsor of the bill. “AB 801 not only holds financial institutions accountable, it will also drive billions of dollars into areas that need it most, creating jobs, expanding affordable housing, supporting homeownership and fostering economic equity.”
California is confronting a series of urgent crises, many of which disproportionately affect Black and Latino families, veterans, and low-to-moderate-income households. Rising costs, predatory lending practices, and chronic underinvestment have left too many Californians locked out of homeownership and financial stability and in dire need of bold solutions. Additionally, as the federal administration advertises its intention to rescind the 2023 final rule of the federal CRA, which called for a more robust evaluation process for banks as well as provisions that would combat displacement, the need for innovative solutions and state-level protections has never been greater.
“We're proud to stand with other Community Development Financial Institutions in support of AB 801 to hold traditional banking institutions accountable for reinvesting in the communities they profit from,” said Luz Castro, Associate Director of Policy at Inclusive Action for the City. “This bill will expand opportunities for entrepreneurs, strengthen local businesses, and bolster the Community Development Financial Institutions’ capacity to increase access to capital and financial services in historically underserved communities. It represents a critical step toward a more just financial system in California.”

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces Legislation to Prevent AI Systems from Impersonating Health Care Providers,2025-02-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland) introduced a new bill, AB 489, that will protect Californians from AI systems that misrepresent “themselves” as health professionals. Specifically, the bill will provide regulators the authority to enforce title protections against those who develop or deploy AI systems that claim to be a licensed or certified health professional.
“Californians deserve truth, honesty, and transparency in their healthcare. Generative AI systems are not licensed health professionals, and they shouldn’t be allowed to present themselves as such. It’s a no-brainer to me,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Generative AI systems are booming across the internet, and for children and those unfamiliar with these systems, there can be dangerous implications if we allow this misrepresentation to continue.”
This legislation, sponsored by SEIU California and the California Medical Association, comes after multiple stories of individuals developing unhealthy relationships with AI chatbots and these same chatbots being found to pose as licensed practitioners. Additionally, AI is taking the health field by storm, with some companies pushing staff to use Generative AI to respond to patients and others developing for-hire ""AI nurses."" This bill ensures consumers are clear about who they are or are not talking to.
“As nurses, we know what it means to be the face and heart of a patient’s medical experience. Our education and training coupled with years of hands-on experience have taught us how to read verbal and nonverbal cues to care for our patients, so we can make sure they get the care they need,"" said Leo Perez, a Pomona Registered Nurse and President of SEIU 121RN. ""Every Californian deserves access to healthcare from a qualified practitioner, who will provide care based on their education, observations, experience, and expertise, not an algorithm.” 
As AI is being deployed across more applications, including in health care, experts and various professional organizations emphasize the importance of transparency to consumers and patients. This bill would establish guardrails within this developing technology for the safety of consumers and children, allowing people to understand when they are receiving professional guidance versus artificial regurgitation. 
Systems that seem human-like pose unique risks to children and individuals with low health or digital literacy. Children, who readily adopt AI, often without their parents' knowledge, have been found to overestimate the trustworthiness and capabilities of AI systems and disclose private and personal stories and information. 
“As AI is increasingly present in the practice of medicine, it is critical we use it thoughtfully and protect patients from unintended risks and harms that can accompany this powerful technology,” said California Medical Association President Shannon Udovic-Constant, M.D. “Patients deserve to know if the medical advice they are receiving is coming from a bot or a trained and qualified health care professional.”
“AB 489 will ensure that Generative AI is not used dishonestly or negligently to confuse and mislead California consumers. I appreciate the wide range of support this legislation has already received and look forward to working with my colleagues in the legislature to get this across the finish line,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
AB 489 is the ninth bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta in this legislative cycle.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces Legislation to Expand Californians' Access to Fluoride Care,2025-01-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland) introduced a new bill, AB 350, that will expand access to fluoride varnish and improve oral health outcomes for children across the state. The bill requires Medi-Cal and commercial plans to cover fluoride varnish in primary care settings for youth under 21 and expand reimbursement opportunities for fluoride varnish application.
“While California bills itself as a national leader, we are in the bottom tier of states concerning kid’s dental health. Across the state, dental issues prevent students from concentrating and even make students miss entire days of school. California must act now,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Fluoride varnish is a safe and effective method to prevent tooth decay, and AB 350 will ensure more Californians can access it.”
The bill will also address disparities in oral health. While nearly 15% of all children in the state experience decayed teeth or cavities annually, Black, Latino, and Spanish-speaking children experience disproportionately higher adverse oral health impacts. 
“We applaud Assemblymember Bonta’s introduction of this critical bill to expand access of fluoride varnish for children enrolled in Medi-Cal and commercial health plans,” said Ted Lempert, President of Children Now. “Fluoride varnish is effective at both preventing and stopping the progression of cavities, which is the most chronic childhood condition and a major contributor to missing school. This is a Pro-Kid bill and Children Now is excited to be a sponsor and work to improve oral health outcomes for children.”
The need for legislation addressing dental care is heightened as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nominee for Secretary of Health & Human Services, is poised to recommend removing fluoride from water systems. Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, voted to remove fluoride from its water supply in 2011; in the years that followed, there was a stark increase in dental decay and cavities in Calgary’s children; the city is now in the process of re-introducing fluoride to its water supply.
 “With fewer than half of children served by Medi-Cal receiving an annual dental visit, AB 350 will expand access points for fluoride varnish to schools and public health settings, ensuring a healthy smile is accessible to more Californians. I am proud to introduce this bill, and I look forward to promoting science-based health policies with my colleagues in the legislature,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
AB 350 is the eighth bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta in this legislative cycle.

I’m happy this action has been paused for the time being.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces Transformational New Bill to Reduce Costs for Families and Improve Health Outcomes,2025-01-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland) introduced a first-of-its-kind piece of legislation that would expand the prohibition on out-of-pocket costs, including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles to all covered health care services provided to children under 21. In 2018, the average Golden State family spent over $3,000 out-of-pocket on their healthcare.
 
“Cost should not prevent California’s youth from being able to access the healthcare they need,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “AB 298 would prohibit out-of-pocket health costs for youth in the state ensuring California families have peace of mind when seeking care for their child. No parent should be forced to choose between a co-pay for their son’s doctor visit and groceries for the next week. Not only will this create healthy children, but those healthy children will turn into healthy adults who will contribute to our economy, have smaller strains on our health system, and lead fulfilling lives.”
 
As Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, Assemblymember Bonta has been committed to creating the healthiest possible California, continuing this effort with her newest bill. AB 298 will encourage families to not delay needed care, improving screening, diagnosis, and early intervention for California’s youth – setting the state up for a healthy and fiscally sustainable future. 
 
""Private insurance cost-sharing can add up for working families. My daughter was healthy until age 15, when she woke up one morning and could not walk. Suddenly, our family was facing unexpected and astronomical copay as she undertook tests, specialty care, medical equipment, multiple surgeries, and physical and occupational therapies to treat her condition. It was very tight for our middle-class, working family. California families must be relieved from the potential of financial devastation as healthcare costs continue to increase,"" said Janis Connallon, Director of Family Voices of CA.
 
Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for mitigating adverse health outcomes and is a valuable step to ensure children become healthy and productive adults. Additionally, out-of-pocket costs have been found to reduce access to care, with one study finding that 30% of families on plans with high out-of-pocket costs were more likely to delay seeking health care for their children.
 
“It is important that children and young adults seek necessary medical care without the fear or burden of high out-of-pocket costs,” said Erin Kelly, Executive Director of Children's Specialty Care Coalition. “This is particularly true of children and youth with medical complexity, where delaying needed care due to financial concerns can easily lead to a worsening of their condition.”
 
 “I’m proud to be introducing this landmark bill, which will save California families money and ensure that we invest in a healthy future. I appreciate the support this bill has already received from our local community and look forward to continuing to advance these priorities with my colleagues in the legislature,” stated Assemblymember Bonta.
 
AB 298 is the sixth bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta in this legislative cycle.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces Bills to Support Reproductive & Maternal Health,2024-12-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, on the first day of the California legislative session, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, announced a package of bills reflecting the Assemblymember’s continued push to improve women’s health in the state. 
“Despite recent progress, it is clear there is still more to do to protect reproductive and maternal health in the state, particularly for our most vulnerable populations, including Black, Latino, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and low-income communities who are facing disproportionately worse health outcomes. I am proud to introduce this package on the first day of the legislative session to ensure California continues its robust leadership in protecting our residents' ability to access care and improving health outcomes for all,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. 
The bills introduced today are:
 
 
AB 40 - THE PROTECTING PREGNANT PATIENTS ACT
AB 40, the Protecting Pregnant Patients Act, would clarify in California state statute that abortion care is an emergency service, ensuring that no one in California would be turned away from care when they need it most.
“I’m introducing the Protecting Pregnant Patients Act because no one facing an emotional, vulnerable, and potentially life-threatening decision should be denied care, told to go home, or forced to drive to the next hospital,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Abortion is healthcare, including emergency care, and this bill makes clear California treats it as such.”
“Everyone experiencing a health emergency has the right to receive stabilizing care, including abortion,” said Onyemma Obiekea, Policy Director, Black Women for Wellness Action Project. “As we learn about devastating story after story of women in abortion ban states who have died because they did not receive the emergency abortion care that they needed, we in California must realize that our state is not immune from such tragedies. When a hospital skirts its duty to provide responsive emergency care, including abortion, it is tantamount to the abortion bans that have caused the untimely and preventable deaths of women and pregnant people across the country. This not only denies pregnant people the right to bodily autonomy, it exacerbates the maternal mortality crisis in our state which disproportionately impacts Black women and birthing people. BWWAP is proud to support this important legislation that clarifies the law and affords our communities tangible access to the rights guaranteed to all Californians.” 
“Hospitals in California have a duty to provide emergency care to anyone coming through their doors who urgently needs to be stabilized to avoid death,” said Ronald Coleman Baeza, Managing Director of Policy with the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network. “No hospital has a right to discriminate against patients based on the type of care they need, and AB 40 makes it clear that reproductive health services, including abortion, must be provided when needed to stabilize a patient. Long standing maternal disparities impacting black women and other communities of color will only worsen if hospitals continue to flagrantly disregard our state’s laws.” 
 
 
AB 55 - BIRTH CENTER LICENSURE STREAMLINING
AB 55 would tackle the worrying trend of California’s birth centers closing. The state of over 38 million people is down to a mere five licensed birth centers. Midwives and nurses at the shuttered and remaining facilities have pointed to overly burdensome and extraneous licensure requirements as a significant factor causing these centers to close.
“California continues to struggle to address concerning trends in maternal health. Even more worrisome is that licensed birth centers, which have been found to improve newborn and maternal health outcomes, have continued to close across the state,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Eliminating requirements that are only driving up prices for providers and are irrelevant to patient safety is a much-needed step to ensure our remaining birth centers can stay afloat and lay the groundwork for more facilities to open. This bill is particularly important for combatting the worsening maternal health trends under our current system that are disproportionately impacting Black and Indigenous pregnant patients and could be better addressed by accessible culturally concordant care.”
Alternative Birth Centers have been found to improve newborn birth rates, decrease the rate of cesarean birth, promote successful breastfeeding, save money, and even decrease racial health disparities.
“The closure of maternity and labor wards throughout the State has created a crisis in access to maternity care that has disproportionately impacted California's low-income, Black, Latine, Indigenous, and rural communities,” said Sandra Poole, Health Policy Advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty. ""AB 55 increases access to birth centers, which provide a safe alternative and excellent outcomes for birthing people and infants. As a proud co-sponsor of AB 55 Western Center on Law and Poverty applauds Assemblymember Bonta's commitment to addressing the crisis in maternity care access for at-risk communities.""
“California’s maternity and reproductive health care crisis demands urgent action. Freestanding birth centers provide high quality, midwifery-led care for families and can expand access in maternity care shortage areas. Yet, onerous licensing requirements, that don't improve safety, are forcing them to close. This legislation is essential to remove barriers, ensure equitable care, and address the need for midwife-led care. Californian families deserve better,"" said Amita Graham, CA Nurse Midwives Association President
“As we face a distressing maternal mortality and morbidity crisis in California, we are witnessing a disturbing uptick in maternity ward closures across our state that is leaving our communities without access to perinatal care,” said Onyemma Obiekea, Policy Director, Black Women for Wellness Action Project. “These closures have resulted in increased barriers to care, exacerbating the crisis and inequities at hand. Birth centers offer quality perinatal healthcare and are equipped to stand in the care gaps left by shuttered maternity wards, but burdensome licensing requirements render their services out of reach for groups most impacted by adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. This critical legislation works to ensure that our communities have access to the quality, dignified perinatal health care that we deserve.”
 
 
AB 50 - OVER-THE-COUNTER BIRTH CONTROL EQUITY
AB 50, will ensure that Medi-Cal recipients will be able to access over-the-counter birth control without having to navigate many of the same barriers they would to get a prescription.
“Over-the-counter birth control is ensuring contraceptives are readily available to more people than ever. We should not stifle this progress by leaving Medi-Cal recipients behind and making low-income communities have to take more steps than their peers on private insurance to access medication,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “AB 50 will ensure equity and fairness by removing these hoops for those on Medi-Cal.”
“If enacted, this bill will advance health equity by making it easier for people, including those enrolled in Medi-Cal, to access over-the-counter contraceptives,” said Christina Piecora, Senior Policy Analyst at the National Health Law Program. “The National Health Law Program is proud to join our partners Essential Access Health and Birth Control Pharmacist in co-sponsoring this important bill removing burdensome and unnecessary self-screening and assessment protocols for pharmacists furnishing over-the-counter contraceptives. We commend Assemblymember Bonta for introducing this bill and stand ready to work with her in taking the next big step toward contraceptive equity in the state.”
“California is a leader in enacting comprehensive and inclusive contraceptive coverage requirements, but work remains to guarantee equitable access to the full range of birth control methods for all Californians,” said Amy Moy, Co-CEO of Essential Access Health. “Action is needed to ensure that Medi-Cal enrollees have the same contraceptive access as people with private health insurance. AB 50 will close a loophole to allow people with Medi-Cal coverage to get over-the-counter methods, including the birth control pill Opill, without a prescription or out-of-pocket costs. As we face an incoming Administration and Congress hostile to reproductive freedom, it’s imperative and time-sensitive for the state to take every step possible to create a more just and equitable health care system for all Californians. We thank Assemblymember Bonta for being a healthy equity champion and for her leadership on this important measure.”
“California continues to lead the way by recognizing pharmacies and pharmacists as an essential access point for reproductive health services and products. With this simple policy change, pharmacists will be able to help people use their health insurance to obtain over-the-counter birth control at no cost. This legislation will enable Californians to access safe and effective medications to maintain their health and achieve their life goals,” said Sally Rafie, Birth Control Pharmacist Founder.
 
 
“I’m thankful for the support these bills have already gotten from my constituents, grassroots organizations, and local leaders and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the legislature to get these crucial pieces of legislation signed into law,” stated Assemblymember Mia Bonta.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Releases Statement on Historic Funding for the Port of Oakland.,2024-11-08,press_release,NA,"Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta released the following statement after an announcement was made late last month that the Port of Oakland would be receiving $322,000,000 in federal funding to support its transition to decarbonization:
“Oakland is worth investing in, and I’m thrilled the Biden-Harris administration agreed and heeded my call to invest in the Port of Oakland, committing to a $322 million investment to fast-track a complete decarbonization of the port. I led a letter of Bay Area elected officials to call for this investment earlier this year because the shift to a green port is crucial. Not only will this investment ensure our port is decarbonized, protecting the health and environment of Oaklanders, but the investments will support Oakland and the surrounding communities’ economic prosperity. This success highlights the power of collaboration and how Oakland continues to provide a blueprint to the nation for a brighter future,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Reacts to Securing $70 Million for Digital Equity in California,2024-11-04,press_release,NA,"Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) released the following statement reacting to the announcement that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) approved California’s application for funding to implement the California Department of Technology’s (CDT) Digital Equity Plan. The plan was created as a result of Assemblymember Bonta’s 2022 bill, AB 2750, which directed the CDT to develop a digital equity plan to identify barriers to digital equity faced by covered populations, document and promote digital equity among covered populations, and assess the impact of increasing digital equity.
“In this era of interconnectivity, affordable broadband is a necessity, and we cannot allow Californians in rural or low-income communities to be left behind. I am beyond thrilled that, due to my legislation, California will receive $70 million in federal funds to achieve our state’s Digital Equity Plan. This will allow us to make much-needed progress to close the ‘digital divide’ and ensure that all Californians, regardless of socio-economic status or race, have equal access to educational opportunities, health care services, employment prospects, and civic life. It is clear to me that there is still progress to be made in ensuring that ALL Californians are brought up to speed. I remain committed to continuing to advance this issue in the legislature,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
Assemblymember Bonta introduced AB 2239 to prohibit digital discrimination in 2024. While the bill did not reach the Governor’s desk, it was heralded as a bill to watch and defied expectations by progressing as far as it did in the face of a well-funded opposition campaign led by the broadband industry.
Assemblymember Bonta remains committed to advancing equity for disconnected Californians in 2025.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s Bill to Reshape Youth Restitution is Signed into Law,2024-10-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – This weekend, Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s (D - Oakland) bill, AB 1186, the REPAIR Act, was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, reshaping California’s approach to our youth restitution System. This bill will directly tackle our current failed system, where it costs more to collect fines than they are worth, and those being ordered to pay restitution have an increased likelihood and severity of future incidents of harm. 
“This is a win for justice and it is a win for public safety. AB 1186 will alleviate the economic hardships faced by many families burdened by youth restitution fines and make the assessment of youth restitution more equitable,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “I am grateful to Governor Newsom for signing this bill to ensure we don’t trap young people in a perpetual cycle of debt, especially for poor Black and brown families.”
The inability to pay restitution often creates long-standing financial harm and instability that prevents young people from moving forward. Two-thirds of those paying restitution indicated that unpaid restitution or fines impacted their ability to afford food and rent, while 60% said it threatened their ability to pay utilities. Furthermore, 93% said it affected their ability to pay other debts. Parents can also be liable for their child’s restitution and subject to unforgiving collection practices and the collateral consequences of court-ordered debt, including negative credit impacts, bank levies, and even property liens.
AB 1186 will provide critical relief by eliminating youth restitution fines, eliminating fines older than 10 years, ending joint & several liability, and ending wage & account garnishment which further drive young people into cycles of poverty.
“Debt Free Justice California applauds Assemblymember Bonta and Governor Newsom for the signing of AB 1186. While California is a leader in debt-free youth justice, mandatory youth restitution fines have undermined the state’s progress as youth and families remain trapped by debt they cannot afford. This important legislation puts young people on a better path towards rehabilitation, making a safer and more equitable California for all,” Brandon Greene, Director of Policy Advocacy at the Western Center for Law and Poverty.
“We are thrilled that AB 1186, the REPAIR Act, has been signed into law and will provide meaningful relief to impacted young people and their families. California must continue to champion a fairer and just juvenile legal system. Thank you to Governor Gavin Newsom and Assemblymember Mia Bonta for championing this bill,” said Sonja Tonnesen-Casalegno, Policy & Legal Director, Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice.
“As shown in our recent report, Living on the Brink, Black and brown families are relegated into the most dangerous and low-paying jobs while also struggling to meet the high costs of childcare and housing. At the same time they are saddled with unfair criminal legal debt. Signing the REPAIR Act brings much needed relief to these families, helping California become a more equitable place to live,” said Jhumpa Bhattacharya, Co-President, The Maven Collaborative.
“The REPAIR Act makes our youth restitution system work better for everyone. I am proud to have authored this crucial bill and to promote effective legislation promoting accountability, rehabilitation, and healing in our criminal justice system,” affirmed Assemblymember Mia Bonta upon learning her bill was signed into law. 
AB 1186 goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

Mia Bonta,WIC Coverage is Extended to Mobile Farmers’ Markets under Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s Bill,2024-10-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – This weekend, Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s (D - Oakland) bill, AB 2786, to allow WIC benefits to be utilized at certified mobile farmers’ markets, was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. With over 940,000 Californians participating in the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), AB 2786 provides these recipients access to a growing source of fresh produce across the state.
“Today is a major win for Californians, for low-income families struggling to access healthy food, for farmers committed to feeding their communities, and for those afflicted by health conditions that could be mitigated through increased access to fresh produce,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Mobile farmers markets are an emerging strategy to bring fresh fruits and vegetables directly to communities. This bill will make nutritious, culturally relevant options more accessible to Californians who may otherwise rely on convenience stores with limited availability of fresh produce.”
AB 2786 establishes the definition of a mobile farmers’ market in state law and requires the Department of Public Health to seek federal approval to authorize mobile farmers’ markets to participate in the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program as vendors. California is home to five active mobile farmers’ markets — operating across Butte, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, and Yolo counties, with an additional slated to serve communities in Alameda, Napa, Los Angeles, and San Luis Obispo counties in the near future.
“I am so excited that Gov. Newsom signed AB 2786! I became a mother at 22. I was a hardworking college student who needed support, and WIC helped me stretch my food budget. Working in nutrition and food equity now, it was difficult to tell customers they could not use their WIC FMNP benefits at our Mobile Farmers Market,” said Darolyn Turner, Nutrition Education and Food Access Specialist at Fresh Approach. “With this bill signed, WIC recipients will be able to support their local farmers and access quality produce for themselves and their families.” 
“We are delighted that Governor Newsom signed AB 2786 to create a legal definition for Certified Mobile Farmers Markets and a new pathway for WIC participants to shop with their benefits to buy healthy, local, and fresh foods. Thanks to Assemblymember Bonta for her leadership in introducing this important legislation to champion better nutrition and health while supporting California's small farmers,"" said Andy Naja-Riese, CEO of the Agricultural Institute of Marin, and operator of the Rollin' Root Mobile Farmers Markets.
“Allowing WIC participants to use their benefits as mobile farmers’ markets will not only increase access to nutritious food for low-income communities but will improve recipient’s long-term health outcomes,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
AB 2786 goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s Bill to Support Survivors of Human Trafficking is Signed into Law,2024-09-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s (D – Oakland) joined Governor Gavin Newsom to celebrate the signing of AB 2020, the Human Trafficking Survivors Act, and uplift the need to center the experiences of survivors in our public policy process. The bill, which goes into effect at the beginning of next year, requires law enforcement agencies to establish policies for law enforcement interactions with human trafficking survivors.
“Survivors of human trafficking need support, not systemic barriers. This bill was born from the ongoing conversations I’ve had with organizations supporting survivors of sex trafficking, law enforcement organizations, and those working in the justice system,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “Sadly, the first time many survivors of trafficking first engage with the government, they are seen as offenders of prostitution or other crimes. Establishing proper protocols for law enforcement interactions with survivors will allow California to combat human trafficking while centering the needs of survivors and advancing trauma-informed justice practices.”
Human trafficking is a persistent issue nationally:
Human trafficking victims are commonly treated as perpetrators of crime by law enforcement:
“AB 2020 is a commonsense, smart solution that advances the health, safety, and well-being of victims of human trafficking,” said Natasha Minsker, Policy Advisor for Smart Justice California. “We thank Assemblymember Bonta for her unwavering commitment to ensuring that law enforcement agencies’ interactions with victims who are seeking safety are trauma-informed and based on best practices.” 
“As an organization of prosecutors and victim advocates, Prosecutors Alliance Action is grateful that Governor Newsom signed Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s bill to help survivors of sexual violence and sex trafficking, improve community care of survivors, and train law enforcement officers to better serve and protect people who have survived sex trafficking,” said Cristine Soto DeBerry, Executive Director of Prosecutors Alliance Action. “It’s practical and compassionate — the kind of policy California needs right now.""
""California takes human trafficking seriously, which is why we are glad to see AB 2020 signed into law today,"" said Barbara Chavez, Outside Policy Fellow for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. ""Survivors must be treated with dignity and respect while receiving the resources they need. We are grateful to Asm. Bonta for finding smart solutions to support survivors with healing and justice.""
“I have been proud of my tenure in the legislature advancing criminal justice policies that provide real support to those who have been cast aside by our society for too long. AB 2020 will provide communities like those I represent with the opportunity to escape cycles of abuse, incarceration, and trafficking,” added Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
AB 2020 goes into effect on January 1, 2025.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Mia Bonta Remains Committed to Advancing “Food as Medicine” Following Bill’s Veto,2024-09-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s (D - Oakland) bill, AB 1975, otherwise known as Food as Medicine, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 1975 would have made medically supportive food and nutrition services a permanent covered benefit for Medi-Cal recipients. The bill was part of the California Legislative Black Caucus’s 2024 Reparations Priority Bill Package.
“Thanks to the ongoing advocacy from our bipartisan coalition of supporters, AB 1975, Food as Medicine, made it all the way to Governor Newsom’s desk,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “While I’m disappointed this bill could not be signed I appreciate the Governor’s support for this policy as outlined in his veto message. As Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, I remain committed to using my lived experiences to advance policies that will expand access to healthy food. I still remember opening the fridge as a child to see only a few stalks of celery and a jar of peanut butter. My mom told me it was because we were on a special diet, but really, it was all we could afford.”
Despite our state being the primary source of the nation’s fruits and vegetables, over 20% of Californians are food insecure, accounting for approximately 8 million people lacking access to properly nutritious food. Diets rich in nutritious food have been proven to be effective strategies for preventing heart disease, diabetes, strokes, and numerous other chronic conditions.
“With the veto of AB 1975, California has missed an opportunity to become the first state in the nation to affirm that access to healthy food is healthcare and should be a Medicaid benefit. We are so thankful for the steadfast commitment to this cause from Assemblymember Bonta and the California Legislative Black Caucus. We are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work to make the provisions that would’ve been afforded by AB 1975 a reality,” said Katie Ettman, Deputy Director, Fullwell. 

“I introduced this legislation to combat systemic issues related to health. Black Californians face disproportionate rates of heart disease, strokes, and diabetes, all of which can be mitigated by a healthy diet. Give us an apple, not angioplasty. Give us a smoothie, not a stent. Give us cauliflower, not a cesarean. I am proud of the conversations this bill advanced surrounding our most vulnerable communities and look forward to continuing this dialogue next year,” added Assemblymember Mia Bonta.
AB 1975 was inspired by the work of former Alameda County Supervisor, Wilma Chan who in 2017 spearheaded ALL IN Alameda County. An initiative designed to address issues at the intersection of poverty and health, launched a series of food as medicine pilot programs intended to address these high levels of food and nutrition insecurity and chronic health conditions.

Mia Bonta,Candidates Will Have More Opportunities for Security Measures Under Bonta Bill,2024-09-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Yesterday, a bill by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland), AB 2041, to increase security opportunities for political candidates and elected officials, was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 2041 updates California's 30 year old candidate finance policies to make them better reflect the modern-day political climate. The bill received bi-partisan support as it traveled through the legislature earlier this year.
AB 2041 will:
“AB 2041 will protect candidates, elected officials, their families, and staff by authorizing personal security as a campaign expense and expanding eligibility for security,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “I will never forget an instance of being on my front lawn and having somebody text me from an unknown number with a creepy note that they were watching me. Since being elected to the Assembly my staff, my family and I continue to be the target of threatening phone calls. This includes one individual hoping my children are kidnapped. Safety should never be something we sacrifice for the good of serving our community. I’m proud to have led this bill to make safety more accessible for those pursuing public service. ”
From California Women’s List’s 2023 Report:
“In just the past five years, I've witnessed concern for personal safety become one of the top factors that actively deter talented women from running for office. That's to California's detriment. When you consider that women candidates experience greater severity of threats and harassment than their male counterparts-- women of color especially, and Black women candidates most egregiously-- you understand why we need trailblazing legislation like Assemblymember Bonta's AB 2041 in order to foster the conditions necessary to truly achieve reflective representation,” said Susannah Delano, Executive Director, Close the Gap CA. “Innovative, responsive leadership like Assemblymember Bonta has demonstrated with AB 2041 is exactly what gives me hope that electing more brilliant women who reflect California's diversity is the most direct route to revitalizing our democracy.” 
“Stalking and harassment have become all too common in today's politics, especially for candidates who are female, LGBTQ+, and candidates of color. These tactics only serve to hurt our political process by intimidating wonderful potential candidates out of participating in our political system,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta. “I'm grateful to Governor Newsom for signing this bill and joining the inclusive and bi-partisan coalition prioritizing safety and an end to political violence.”
AB 2041 follows a similar effort from Bonta, which was vetoed last year. As part of Assemblymember Bonta’s ongoing commitment to making our democracy to all, she reworked the bill through the legislature again this year, where it received bi-partisan support.
AB 2041 goes into effect immediately.

Mia Bonta,"Assemblymember Mia Bonta, VSP Vision Eyes of Hope, and the Native American Health Center Bring FREE Eye Exams and Glasses to Oakland Community Members in Need",2024-09-10,press_release,NA,"
OAKLAND – On Sept. 6, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland) and VSP Vision™ Eyes of Hope® sponsored a community vision care event hosted by the Native American Health Center that brought eye care to Oaklanders in need.
The event provided approximately 75 adults and children in the Oakland area with free eye exams and, for those in need, free prescription glasses. Most glasses were provided the same day on board the mobile clinic, allowing patients to receive eye care and eyewear in the same visit.
The press conference celebrated the collaboration between Assemblymember Mia Bonta, VSP Vision, and the Native American Health Center, as well as the fundamental care provided at the East Oakland event. The event was possible due to doctors who provided care to the patients, many of whom received their first-ever vision exam and prescription eyewear at the clinic.
Eye health and clear vision benefit education, employment, quality of life, overall health and so much more, yet 1.1 billion people around the world live with vision impairment and can’t get the care they need for a variety of reasons.
“I didn’t have eye care insurance until my late 20s, so being able to provide this opportunity for the community is incredibly meaningful. If we can help a young child in their first days of school, or an elder trying to walk around their community by just providing this essential service of vision care, then we are doing the right thing. Proper vision care is a right, regardless of where you live or how much money you make, so this is the best form of meeting community where they are. Beautiful things happen in Oakland,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D – Oakland). “We saw over 1,000 bills in the legislative session, and I got to author a bill, AB 2340, that is actually waiting for the Governor to sign right now and will improve access to early observation, intervention, and health screenings for young children. That, to me, is an embodiment of what this event shows we need every single day.”
“For many in our community, access to quality eye care remains out of reach due to lack of insurance or financial constraints. This is why the VSP Eyes of Hope platform is so crucial,” said Dr. Anjuli Piya of the Native American Health Center. “Today marks a significant step in our ongoing mission to provide comprehensive health care to our community. We’re thrilled to host this eye clinic for uninsured individuals, in collaboration with Assemblymember Mia Bonta and VSP® Vision Care.”
“Over 75 Oaklanders received eye exams today and glasses if they needed them,” said Pat McNeil, Chief Communications Officer of VSP Vision. “This was a particularly special event for VSP Vision Eyes of Hope because VSP started right here in Oakland, California, in 1955. As of today, over 4 million people in need have received no-cost eye care and eyewear through our VSP Vision Eyes of Hope programs alongside great partners like Assemblymember Mia Bonta and the Native American Health Center.”
“Thank you, Assemblymember Mia Bonta, for your continued leadership in our community. As Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, you have been a champion of healthcare policies in our state that increase access to care for those who need it most. Not only are you doing wonderful work at the state level, but you’re here on the ground in your district,” said Natalie Aguilera, CEO of the Native American Health Center. “Thank you to VSP Vision, Assemblymember Mia Bonta, and the incredible NAHC team; this partnership provided over 75 community members, including women, children, and elders, with no-cost vision care by meeting our community where they are at.”

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Bonta Introduces Legislation to Make “Food as Medicine” Interventions a Permanent Medi-Cal Benefit,2024-02-02,press_release,NA,"(SACRAMENTO) – Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), has announced groundbreaking legislation, AB 1975, aimed at improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare spending by transitioning medically supportive food and nutrition interventions to permanent benefits under Medi-Cal. These evidence-driven services are currently being piloted as part of California's Medi-Cal transformation initiative, CalAIM. If passed, this legislation would make California the first state in the nation to provide these services as covered benefits.
“Adequate food and nutrition are fundamental in preventing and treating chronic conditions, particularly among Californians of color who are disproportionately affected” affirmed Assemblymember Bonta. “Making these interventions permanent would advance health equity by providing services to those impacted by diet-sensitive chronic conditions.”
In the first 18 months of the state's CalAIM initiative, food-based interventions ranked second in utilization out of 14 pilot services aimed at addressing social drivers of health. As of July 2023, more than 26,000 Californians have accessed medically supportive food and nutrition services.
Champions of the food as medicine movement, including the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR) and the Food as Medicine Collaborative, highlight the benefits of incorporating medically supportive food and nutrition into patient care.
""We have an opportunity to expand proven programs and more deeply integrate food as medicine into standard patient care,"" said Assemblymember Bonta.
AB 1975 will be heard in the Assembly Health Committee in the coming months.

Mia Bonta,Child Support Repayment Timeline for Formerly Incarcerated Parents is Extended,2023-10-10,press_release,NA,"(Sacramento) – Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-18) and Root & Rebound, a reentry legal resource organization, announced the signing of a new California bill, AB 1148, the Stable Parents, Stable Children Act. AB 1148 brings crucial reform to the child support system by extending the time for formerly incarcerated parents to resume child support payments from one month or less after exiting incarceration to 10 months.
Family Code §4007.5(b) requires that child support obligations resume on the first day of the month after an incarcerated person is released. If parents are unable to pay, they face punitive consequences such as suspension of their driver’s license and increased interest on the amount of child support owed.
“Over 75 percent of outstanding child support debt in California is owed by parents who could not afford to pay their original child support order,” explained Assemblymember Bonta. “The current system sets people up for failure because it fails to recognize barriers people re-entering into society face, particularly the difficulty in finding stable employment.”
Data shows it can take individuals more than six months to find stable employment post-incarceration, but in reality, according to women served by Root and Rebound, it can take formerly incarcerated people on average a year to find stable employment. Research shows the unemployment rate for formerly incarcerated people is nearly five times higher than the unemployment rate for the general United States population. 
“Parents may resort to working in underground economies out of fear of being unable to provide for themselves. Having insufficient income only elongates reentry journeys because when support payments are not received as ordered, it results in harsh punishments for the formerly incarcerated parent and creates additional economic reentry barriers,” said Assemblymember Bonta. 
""We applaud the state legislature for recognizing child support debt is a financial barrier that not only harms formerly incarcerated parents, but also families and children,"" said Claudia J. Gonzalez, Central Valley Policy Associate at Root & Rebound. ""This bill will be life-changing for impacted people, especially those in rural communities of the Central Valley as it provides them the opportunity to stabilize themselves instead of immediately incurring debt. We applaud Governor Newsom for signing this bill into law and supporting impacted families.""
In addition to the financial challenges, a parent’s inability to pay child support harms children and research shows parents who are in arrears on child support are less likely to have relationships with their children.
Even the federal government recognizes the harm to children from child support orders parents are unable to pay. The 2016 federal government child support requirements state that setting orders “beyond a noncustodial parent’s ability to pay can result in a number of deleterious effects, including unmanageable debt, reduced low-wage employment, increased underground activities, crime, incarceration, recidivism, and reduced contact with their children.”
“This bill truly is a mechanism for formerly incarcerated parents to obtain some financial stability while supporting family reunification and providing for their families,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta upon learning her bill had been signed into law.
AB 1148 goes into effect January 1, 2024.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Bonta Pushes for Prison Rehabilitation and Reentry Preparation for Incarcerated People,2023-10-09,press_release,NA,"(Sacramento) – AB 1104, a bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) to ensure California prisons continue to move towards a more rehabilitative approach—while also emphasizing the central role of community-based organizations—has been signed into law, allowing the state to take progressive steps into rehabilitative, restorative, and transformative change for incarcerated people. 
“AB 1104 emphasizes the importance of incarcerated individuals being afforded opportunities for restorative justice, trauma healing, education, and participation in community-based programming designed to assist in successful reintegration after release,” explained Assemblymember Bonta. “Simply put, the deprivation of liberty due to incarceration, in and of itself, satisfies the punishment aspect of sentencing, and that the purpose of incarceration is to rehabilitate a person so they can be successfully reintegrated into the community.”
In 2016, the legislature directed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to create a mission statement that moved away from punitive punishment and towards a more restorative justice approach. However, California’s Penal Code does not align with and has not been adjusted to reflect this momentous change in mission, value, and goals. 
Additionally, the Penal Code fails to reflect the importance or role of community-based programs in prisons. The California prison system requires a shift in culture to provide incarcerated people with the support and resources needed to reintegrate back into society. Community-Based Organizations are best positioned to provide these quality services to incarcerated people and decrease the chances of recidivism.
“This bill supports the California Model, which must include the full participation of community-based organizations in transforming the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. For too long, our prison system has said the right words but continued to adhere to outdated and ineffective punitive policies. It’s time to make changes on the ground that will advance safety and accountability for all of California. It’s time for our prisons to reflect our values in more than words,” stated Kenneth Hartman, Director of Advocacy for the Transformative In-Prison Workgroup, the sponsor of this bill.
California requires a significant paradigm shift in how we think about incarceration, rehabilitation, and re-entry services. More than 95 percent of incarcerated people will be released back into the community. 
“Californians want to hold people who cause harm accountable, but they also want them to have access to programs that will enable them to successfully reintegrate into society. By all accounts, our decades-old approach of warehousing people is a demonstrable failure with overcrowded prisons and high recidivism rates. Today, with the signing of AB 1104, we begin to right this course,” stated Jim Lindburg with the Friends Committee on Legislation of California. 
“Currently, CBOs are funded at less than half of one percent of the entire CDCR budget and that is a missed opportunity. The significance of this bill in restructuring our Penal Code and uplifting the work Community-Based Organizations do in prisons is not lost on me. This year, having served as Chair of Budget Sub-5, I worked to increase opportunities for CBOs. I am confident this bill will help to continue to push the needle in that direction,” stated Assemblymember Bonta upon learning her bill was signed into law.
AB 1104 goes into effect January 1, 2024.

Mia Bonta,AB 1273 Ensures All Schools Have Adequate Staffing for a Safe Working and Learning Environment,2023-10-09,press_release,NA,"(Sacramento, CA) – AB 1273 by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), a bill that establishes a workgroup to propose guidelines on proper staffing for classified school employees, has been signed into law. This bill will help support students and staff by ensuring local educational agencies are adequately staffed to provide students with the services and resources they need to thrive.
Current law is silent on what factors local education agencies should consider in establishing staff-to-student ratios. AB 1273 will ensure all school community members have a safe working and learning environment.
“Thank you to Governor Newsom for signing this bill and recognizing the importance of ensuring adequate staffing to keep our schools safe and clean. Whether we face environmental challenges due to pandemics or climate change, schools must ensure there is someone to call if there is an emergency, ensure students reach the school safely with bus drivers or crossing guards, have food served in a timely manner, and make sure that rooms and playgrounds are clean and safe for all students and staff. We are so thankful to Assemblymember Bonta for authoring this important bill,” said Jeff Freitas, President of the California Federation of Teachers, sponsor of AB 1273.
“Inadequate staffing ratios can have a very detrimental effect on the success of students. This can range from disorderly food distributions that impact healthy eating options in cafeterias to temporarily shuttered classrooms due to cleanliness issues and more,” explained Assemblymember Bonta upon learning her bill was signed into law. “AB 1273 will provide guidance to schools in developing optical staffing ratios, and in turn, help students reach their full potential.”
AB 1273 goes into effect July 1, 2024.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Bonta Safeguards and Protects Jobs of Unionized Physicians,2023-10-02,press_release,NA,"(SACRAMENTO) – A bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), AB 722, aimed at safeguarding the cost-effectiveness of healthcare services provided by the Alameda Health System (AHS) and protecting the jobs of unionized physicians was signed into law in the evening of Saturday, September 30. 
“In 2013, when the Alameda Health Care Systems acquired San Leandro hospital, and in response to fears raised by many of the physicians and surgeons that their jobs would be contracted out, this legislature requires AHS to provide clear and convincing evidence that contracting out would be more cost-efficient. That requirement is set to expire at the start of this year,” explained Assemblymember Bonta. AB 722 extends the sunset date from January 1, 2024, to January 1, 2035. The unions representing these health care workers and AHS worked with Assemblymember Bonta on this sunset extension.
AHS is governed by a board of trustees appointed by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and employs about 5,000 people, including 700 physicians across the several hospitals, wellness centers, and other health facilities it operates throughout Alameda County. Major components of the countywide system include:
“It is consequential that we continue to protect public service employees and prevent temporary contractors from providing short-term services to patients who require long-term dedication and care. We applaud Assemblymember Bonta for her commitment in working to protect the jobs of physicians and surgeons who have contracts with the Alameda Health System,"" said Alia Griffing, Political and Legislative Director with AFSCME California, one of the co-sponsors of this bill.
“As a lifelong labor leader, I recognize the importance of AB 722. Without this bill, we risk leaving room for decisions that may not align with the best interest of employees or the community,” said Assemblymember Ortega, a co-author of this bill whose district is also served by AHS.
“Privatization, or subcontracting of public services, can be a deceptive practice. In healthcare settings, overreliance on subcontracting can result in a gradual decline of quality of care. This is why we are so thankful to Assemblymember Bonta for her steadfast commitment to protecting our jobs. We also appreciate the legislature for their support and Governor Newsom for signing this important bill,” said Dr. Milton Lorig, a former physician, AHS member, and member of the Union of American Physicians and Dentists (UAPD), a co-sponsor of AB 722.
Upon learning her bill had been signed into law, Assemblymember Bonta concluded, “It is imperative that we maintain a rigorous standard when it comes to outsourcing services, especially those provided by union members. AB 722 is a testament to our commitment to accountability in delivering cost-effective healthcare services that prioritize the well-being of our employees and the community we serve.”
AB 722 goes into effect January 1, 2024.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Bonta Codifies Authorization for State Lands Commission to Transfer Land to City of Alameda,2023-07-31,press_release,NA,"(SACRAMENTO) – A bill introduced by Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) to authorize an agreement between the State Lands Commission and the City of Alameda has been signed into law, allowing the City to move forward with the development of the 32-acre site known as Encinal Terminals.
“Over ten years ago, the City of Alameda re-zoned the property for housing, but due to the intersection of the private and public land, has not been able to begin any development. Currently, the publicly owned parcel is inaccessible to the public because the parcel is land-locked with no access to water, no utilities, and no public access,” explained Assemblymember Bonta.
In August 2022, the State Lands Commission approved a Land Exchange and Title Settlement Agreement that would resolve the boundary disputes and reconfigure the public trust lands at the Encinal Terminals through a series of conveyances between the city, North Waterfront Cove LLC, and the state. The Encinal Terminals property is a 32-acre site in the City of Alameda. It consists of four parcels, three of which are privately owned, and a 6.4-acre tideland parcel that is publicly owned. The agreement also would facilitate the mixed-use development at the waterfront site, which includes residential uses, a bay-trail waterfront promenade, park, and plazas. The conveyances proposed in the agreement require the Legislature’s approval to grant the lands that are conveyed into the public trust back to the city, in trust. With Legislative approval, those lands, once conveyed, would fall under the State Land Commission’s control and management.
“The City of Alameda thanks Assemblymember Bonta for authoring Assembly Bill 1706 which facilitates the productive reuse and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized lands within the City of Alameda for much needed housing, maritime uses, and publicly available open space. The City was proud to co-sponsor Assembly Bill 1706 with the California State Lands Commission and looks forward to breaking ground on this once blighted property that sat vacant for over 10 years. Thank you Assemblymember Bonta for bringing this tremendous new amenity to the City of Alameda which will be enjoyed by the surrounding East Bay region,” stated Andrew Thomas, Acting Director of Base Reuse and Economic Development in Alameda.
""AB 1706 is an important bill for the City and the community. It’s so great that my first bill signed is one that will deliver for my district. With the signing of the bill, the City can move forward with plans to build 589 housing units, provide access to more than 4 acres of waterfront parks, and turn 13 acres of submerged lands into a marina. This is a win for everyone,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta.
Assemblymember Bonta partnered with the City of Alameda, the State Lands Commission, Alameda Chamber & Economic Alliance, Bike Walk Alameda, East Bay YIMBY and North Waterfront Cove, LLC.

Mia Bonta,Alameda Family Services Named 2023 Non-Profit of the Year by Assemblymember Bonta,2023-06-08,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Bonta honors Alameda Family Services as the 2023 California Nonprofit of the Year. AFS’ work and contributions to Alameda and to the greater Assembly District 18 were highlighted and uplifted at a ceremony in Sacramento on Wednesday, June 7.
Alameda Family Services (AFS) began in 1969 as The Love—In Switchboard, a teen hotline born of a mother’s desire to ease the many adversities burdening the young people of her community. AFS has broadened into a well-established agency fostering healing, resiliency, and growth through the delivery of progressive and comprehensive mental health, early childhood education, and family support services to individuals and families at all ages and stages of life.
This is the eighth year of the California Nonprofit of the Year initiative, a state-wide effort honoring the critical role nonprofit organizations play in California. 
“Alameda Family Services encapsulates community. Their intentional work for newborns, childcare assistance, and promoting successful student outcomes. Additionally, Alameda Family Services understands the needs for individual and family wellness by offering holistic services to address mental health, housing, and workforce referrals, and working with Alameda Fire Department with their CARE response program to address mental health crisis,” explained Assemblymember Bonta. “That is the type of community care all deserve,” she concluded.
“When anyone talks about delivering meals to seniors, inspiring with music, protecting fresh water, educating children, championing the disadvantaged, speaking out for human rights, caring for animals . . . they are talking about work that nonprofits do,” noted Jan Masaoka, CEO of the California Association of Nonprofits (CalNonprofits), which serves as a partner for this awards program. “California Nonprofit of the Year gives elected leaders the opportunity to shine a light on what nonprofits are accomplishing for the people in their districts and for everyone to appreciate the collective impact of nonprofits across our state.”
“It is an honor for Alameda Family Services to be recognized by Assemblymember Mia Bonta for our work by, and for, City of Alameda residents” said Katherine Schwartz, Executive Director of Alameda Family Services. “Being selected through the California State Legislature as the District 18 Nonprofit of the Year, Alameda Family Services' focus on the wellbeing of the community as a whole is elevated as an important California value. Alameda Family Services operates at the nexus of family, health, education, and partnerships in our pursuit of fostering healing resiliency, and growth through the delivery of progressive and comprehensive services to individuals and families at all stages in life. We are deeply grateful to Assemblymember Mia Bonta for this distinction.”
“For nearly 55 years, AFS has been deeply rooted in the City of Alameda and continues to be a safe, inclusive, compassionate, and respectful resource for those seeking greater emotional, psychological, and physical wellbeing in Alameda and beyond,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta.

Mia Bonta,2023 California State Basketball Champions are Honored in Special Recognition at the State Capitol,2023-05-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Monday, April 24, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) and Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) honored the Oakland High School Boys Basketball Team and the Oakland Tech High School Girls Basketball Team for their victory this year as the 2023 California High School Basketball Champions.

On the same day, the Oakland Technical High School girls basketball team, beat Santiago High School of Corona 75 to 52. The 2023 victory is the THIRD consecutive title that the Lady Bulldogs bring home.
“I am incredibly proud of both the Wildcats and Lady Bulldogs for such a historic season,” said Assemblymember Bonta during the recognition on the Assembly floor.
“Oakland has proven again that it’s the ‘City of Champions,’” said Senator Skinner, “It was my great privilege to honor the Town’s two newest champions at the State Capitol: The Oakland Tech High School Lady Bulldogs and Oakland High’s Wildcats.

They do this enough because they rise, and because they are strong and they are proud, and they make Oakland proud of who they are and what they are able to do. They show California and the country what the Town is – all heart, all spirit, all resilience, all love. Congratulations to our student athletes, your determination and hard work is paying off and you all have proven yourselves as leaders both on and off the court,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta during the recognition on the Assembly Floor.

Mia Bonta,“Food as Medicine” Initiative Launched in California,2023-04-26,press_release,NA,"Medically Supportive Food and Nutrition Advocates Gather in Support of AB 1644 to Improve Patient Health and Lower Soaring Health Care Costs
(Sacramento, CA) – On Tuesday, April 25 physicians, patients, and food equity experts met at the State Capitol to express their support for Assembly Bill 1644, authored by Assemblyperson Mia Bonta, D-Oakland. Champions of the food as medicine movement, including the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, (SPUR), stressed the many benefits of incorporating medically supportive food and nutrition into patient care in California, including improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
“California has recognized the critical role of nutrition and its influence on health outcomes and health equity,” said Bonta. “Too many Californians, particularly Californians of color, are living with largely preventable chronic conditions. Adequate food and nutrition are a fundamental part of preventing and treating chronic conditions, and can significantly improve a patient's quality of life and health status while also reducing healthcare costs,” she concluded.
Behaviors related to diet, exercise and smoking are major factors in determining health status and the likelihood of chronic disease. Food as medicine programs aim to leverage targeted interventions to prevent, manage, treat and, in some instances, reverse disease by improving nutrition to help children and adults get well and stay healthy. These programs exist in the context of other food assistance programs, such as the CalFresh Program and the Women, Infants and Children program; other efforts such a program in Alameda County lead by former Supervisor Wilma Chan.
AB 1644 will make medically supportive food and nutrition interventions a covered benefit under the Medi-Cal program and will require medically supportive food and nutrition interventions to be covered when determined to be medically necessary by a health care provider.
Medically supportive food and nutrition interventions is a plan comprised of nutrient rich whole food to improve patients’ heath through medically tailored meals, food pharmacies, medical tailored groceries, produce prescriptions and cooking/behavioral coaching.
“Providing medically supportive food and nutrition services to eligible individuals with specific medical conditions is a crucial step in promoting health equity and reducing the burden of diet-related illnesses. AB 1644 will help ensure that Californians have access to the care they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives,” said SPUR’s food and agriculture policy manager Katie Ettman.
Joining Assemblymember Bonta at the launch of the initiative was Speaker-Designate Robert Rivas (D-Salinas), Assemblymember Damon Connolly (D-San Rafael) and Assemblymember Isaac Bryan (D-Los Angeles) who had the following to say:
“We have an opportunity to expand proven nutrition programs and more deeply integrate food as medicine into standard patient care,” said Bonta.
“Give us an apple, not angioplasty. California is the largest producer of food in the United States. This fact alone makes it imperative that our state leads the way in making sure that access to healthy food and nutrition education is available to all who can benefit,” she added.
AB 1644 was heard in Assembly Health Committee and passed out with a 12-0 vote. It now moves to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Mia Bonta,"Elaine Brown, former leader of the Black Panther Party and the CEO of Oakland & the World Enterprises, Inc. is honored on the Assembly Floor by Assemblymember Bonta",2023-03-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) honored Elaine Brown for making HERstory as part of the Women’s Caucus annual celebration of Women’s History Month.
“Elaine Brown is a social justice advocate, story teller, trailblazer, accomplished musician and a strong advocate for communities of color especially when it comes to breaking barriers to employment,” said Assemblymember Bonta. “Elaine is high energy, compassionate and steadfast in her beliefs. Not to mention, has had an amazing career. She was the only woman to ever lead the Black Panther Party, she has spent 25 years advocating for the release of an innocent Black man, who at the age of 13, was convicted of a crime he didn’t commit and is currently constructing a 79-unit all-affordable apartment complex in Oakland.”
Elaine grew up in the ghettos of North Philadelphia, is a “Distinguished Graduate” of the Philadelphia High School for Girls, and attended Temple University, UCLA, Mills College and Southwestern University School of Law. 
Elaine joined the Black Panther Party in 1968 and helped the party set up its first Free Breakfast for Children program in Los Angeles, as well as the Party's initial Free Busing to Prisons Program and Free Legal Aid Program. Elaine chaired the Black Panther Party from 1974 until 1977. She moved to France in 1990 and returned to the US in 1996 and found the Fields of Flowers, Inc., a non-profit organization, in Atlanta Georgia committed to providing educational opportunities for impoverished African-American children.
Elaine is the Executive Director of the Michael Lewis Legal Defense Committee, supporting the legal appeal of Lewis (“Little B”), who, arrested in 1997 in Atlanta, Georgia, at the age of 13 for a murder he did not commit, was convicted and sentenced as an adult to life in prison, where he remains. The legal battle for his freedom continues.
Elaine is CEO of the non-profit organization Oakland & the World Enterprises, Inc. (OAW), dedicated to launching and sustaining for-profit businesses for cooperative ownership by formerly incarcerated and other people facing extreme barriers to economic survival. OAW’s current housing project, The Black Panther, will have a 79-unit 100% affordable housing complex for people with very low and extremely low incomes. Elaine is purposely hiring formerly incarcerated and Black contractors.
“To be recognized by Assemblymember Mia Bonta for my work as a former leader of the Black Panther Party and, now, as an affordable housing developer is an honor. More, though, to be among the significant women also recognized by the entire California Legislature at the March 20, 2023, Women’s History Month ceremony for California Women Making HERstory was the highest honor for me” explained Elaine. “The collective and respective contributions of the other women so recognized, the doctors and teachers and social activists and humanitarians, is so powerful as to allow me to stand taller and work harder in the interests of all people and the planet. I am grateful.”
 Women’s History Month was established by Congress in the 1980s to acknowledge that the significant contributions women have made to every field of American life were largely undocumented and unknown. The purpose of the month was to recognize and highlight women’s unsung specific achievements in science, technology, arts, business, and more.
“It is truly an honor for me to recognize Elaine Brown on the Assembly Floor for making HERstory. She is truly an icon. Her work, her legacy, her tenacity and her commitment to making Oakland, and this state a better place is worthy of celebrating,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta.

Mia Bonta,Assemblymember Bonta Introduces Bill to Continue State’s Effort to Transform California’s Prison System,2023-02-16,press_release,NA,"(SACRAMENTO, CA) – Today, Assemblymember Bonta (AD-18) introduced a bill to continue moving California’s prison system away from the hyper-punitive approach that characterized the era leading to mass incarceration and toward a system that centers rehabilitation, humanity and healing. AB 1104 changes California’s penal code to make clear that the purpose of incarceration is rehabilitation and preparation for reentry, not levying additional punishment.
Current law states that the purpose of sentencing is “public safety achieved through punishment, rehabilitation, and restorative justice” but is silent on the purpose of incarceration. AB 1104 states that “the deprivation of liberty satisfies the punishment purpose of sentencing.”
“My bill calls for incarcerated individuals being afforded enhanced opportunities for restorative justice, trauma healing, education, and participation in community-based programming designed to assist in successful reintegration after release,” explained Assemblymember Bonta. The purpose of this legislation is to speed the process away from the failed policies of the past, and toward a healing and restorative future inside of California’s prisons.
“Moving the prison system of California toward a system that prioritizes rehabilitation, healing, and restorative justice is both smart in the sense of better outcomes and more humane. A more humane and healthy environment for prison residents is also a safer and healthier workplace for staff. In my work with the Norwegian prisons, I have found that humanity and effectiveness reinforce each other. Our Penal Code should reflect these principles.” (Brie Williams, MD, Professor of Medicine at UCSF, Director of Amend at UCSF)
Despite their important role in providing rehabilitative programming throughout the prison system, community-based prison programs receive less than 1% of CDCR’s $14B annual budget. AB 1104 facilitates the continued success and expansion of community based programs by clarifying that prisons should not serve to increase suffering and pain and instead invest in healing and growth through the participation of community-run programs.
“This small but significant change to the California Penal Code enshrines the idea that programs provided by the community have an important role in the rehabilitation of incarcerated people. It’s long past time to move away from the antiquated eye-for-an-eye approach, which has failed at every level. We are excited to support this crucial step toward bringing more humanity into the prison system.” (Ken Hartman, Director of Advocacy, Transformative in-Prison Workgroup)
In line with Governor Newsom’s efforts to move the state’s prison system closer to the Norwegian Model of corrections, this bill further centers the ideals of a more humane and compassionate prison system. Investing in the rehabilitation of incarcerated people is an investment in California’s future. It is also another step in the long process of dismantling the racist, classist, and cruel systems of imprisonment in this country.
“Community based organizations provide an essential lifeline to incarcerated people. Its time our laws reflect how much we value and prioritize their contribution to successful rehabilitation and healing,” concluded Assemblymember Bonta.
AB 1104 (Bonta) is sponsored by The Transformative in-Prison Workgroup (www.thetpw.org), a coalition of 85 community-based organizations providing rehabilitative programming inside all of California’s prisons.
AB 1104 is expected to be heard in the Assembly next month.

Mia Bonta,California Bill Will Protect People Seeking Abortion and Gender-Affirming Care from Dragnet Digital Surveillance,2023-02-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) introduced AB 793 a bill that works to support safe access to reproductive and gender-affirming care in the digital age by protecting people from unconstitutional searches of their data.
“With states across the country passing anti-abortion and anti-trans legislation, it’s vital that California shore up our protections against digital tracking of vulnerable people seeking healthcare,” said Assemblymember Bonta. “This legislation will put a stop to unconstitutional “reverse warrants” – preserving our digital privacy and protecting Californians’ right to live life on our own terms.”
AB 793 targets a type of dragnet surveillance demand that can compel tech companies to search their records and reveal the identities of all people who have driven down a certain street or looked up a particular keyword online. These demands, known as “reverse warrants”, “geofence warrants,” or “keyword warrants,” enable local law enforcement in states across the country to request the names and identities of all people whose digital data shows they’ve spent time near a California abortion clinic or searched for information about gender-affirming care online.
“Between 2018 and 2020, Google alone received more than 5,700 reverse warrant demands from states that now have anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ legislation on the books,” said Hayley Tsukayama, Senior Legislative Activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “As a worldwide leader in technology and innovation, California is uniquely positioned to divest from digital surveillance that would target people for having an abortion or seeking reproductive and gender-affirming care.”
“Carrying a smartphone, using social media, and allowing apps to know our location has become a part of our daily routines,” said Becca Cramer-Mowder, Legislative Advocate at ACLU California Action. “But it means that each of us has a vast data trail that is vulnerable to government abuse. Anti-abortion police and prosecutors have used digital data to criminalize people for their abortion long before Roe v. Wade was overturned, and law enforcement in other states have already abused reverse warrants to identify people protesting police violence. We need to put a stop to this type of dragnet surveillance.”
“As states across the country pass anti-abortion legislation, it’s vital that states like California do everything in their power to create protections against digital tracking. Our digital surveillance infrastructure has been weaponized again and again to surveil, target, and criminalize Black, brown, and Indigenous people, poor people, immigrants, and queer and trans people,” said Myra Durán, Senior Policy Advocate at If/When/How. “No one should face or fear criminalization for their abortion or gender affirming care. Criminalization creates a detrimental life-long domino effect–people can lose their jobs, housing, custody of their children, immigration status, and community. When we decide to end our pregnancies, we should be able to do so with dignity, and without fear of being arrested, investigated, or jailed.”
“With every technological advancement, there is an opportunity for abuse. None is scarier than the potential for the abuse to invade personal and private healthcare decisions,” stated Assemblymember Bonta.
A coalition of more than 25 reproductive justice, civil liberties, and privacy groups have already signed on to support the bill. With the introduction of AB 793 California joins the vanguard of states that have taken action to protect people from reverse warrants, including New York, Massachusetts, and Missouri.
AB 793 is expected to be heard in the Assembly next month.

Mia Bonta,"Facing Rise in Political Violence, Assemblymember Mia Bonta Introduces Legislation to Improve Candidate, Elected Official, Family and Staff Security",2022-12-06,press_release,NA,"(SACRAMENTO, CA) – In response to the rising tide of political violence in California and the United States, Assemblymember Mia Bonta (D-Oakland) introduced Assembly Bill (AB) 37 on the very first day of the 2023 legislative session to improve security for candidates, elected officials, their family, and staff.
 
Across the state, candidates and elected officials faced frequent threats of violence during the 2022 election cycle. In Palm Springs, State Assembly candidate Christy Holstege used her social media as a platform to describe, and bring attention to, her personal experiences dealing with hateful and harassing comments during her campaign.
 
Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and former Senator Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) have received numerous threats for their LQBTQ-inclusive and pro-public health legislation. Additionally, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) was on the receiving end of unwarranted horrible messages and harassment, including a trucker convoy that drove around her neighborhood, for her work in protecting reproductive rights and abortion access.
 
“As public servants, there is a lot we sacrifice to serve, this includes spending time with family and our privacy. However, the one thing we should never be willing or expected to give up is our sense of safety. Unfortunately, we have seen an increase in threats against public officials, especially women, and harassment against legislative staff who are serving the constituents who elected us to office,” explained Assemblymember Bonta.
 
The political rhetoric across the country is becoming increasingly alarming, with lawmakers across the country from local school boards to congressional leaders constantly receiving threats. “When Trump took office as President and spewed lie after lie about how the election was stolen, radicalized followers have taken it upon themselves to confront public officials, and even their family members, by any means necessary, often justifying the need for violence,” said Assemblymember Bonta.
 
Data from the Public Policy Institute of California found that voters believe political violence across the country is going to increase and those perpetrating the violence will believe its justified. Further, testimony from the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, threats against federal officials have skyrocketed, increasing from 902 threats investigated by the Capitol Police in 2016 to 9,600 in 2021. What is even more alarming is that women in elected office are disproportionally targeted.
 
Under current law, campaign funds can be used to pay for in home or office security systems but that is limited solely for the protection of the candidate or elected official once the threat has been verified by a law enforcement agency.
 
“Since I was first elected to public office in 2010, we’ve seen a terrifying spike in threats and violence against elected officials – myself included. It’s been harrowing to deal with endless threats on social media; I’ve gotten thousands over the past few years. A couple of months ago, we’ve even received bomb threats and bomb-sniffing dogs had to search my home. I’m grateful to Assemblymember Bonta for her work to make sure elected officials, our staff and our families are protected,” said Senator Wiener.
 
“Our number one job as legislators is to protect the people we serve, and that duty includes our families, our staff, and ourselves,” said Assemblymember Wicks. “As radicalized extremists’ harassment and intimidation tactics continue to grow, so must our ability to maintain a sense of security. I applaud Assemblymember Bonta for bringing forth this important bill, one that will bring California up to speed with what is allowed on the federal level.” 
 
AB 37 expands on current law by allowing candidates and elected officials to use campaign funds for the protection of themselves, their families, or their staff. This protection includes security systems and security personnel. AB 37 will mirror what is currently allowed on the federal level.
 
“Political violence is never the answer. When reactionary elements fan the flames of violence, they are putting candidates and elected officials squarely in their sights. Holding public office is about serving your community, but we never signed up for violence, and our families and children must be protected,” said Assemblymember Bonta.
 
AB 37 will be heard in the Assembly early in 2023.

Juan Carillo,"Assemblymember Juan Carrillo Leads Adoption of HR 16 on Assembly Floor, Honoring Cinco de Mayo and Latino Resilience",2025-05-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Today, the California State Assembly adopted House Resolution 16 (HR 16), honoring the cultural legacy, resilience, and vital contributions of the Latino community in celebration of Cinco de Mayo. The resolution was presented by Assemblymember Juan Carrillo (D–Palmdale), Vice Chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus.
“Cinco de Mayo is a symbol of resistance and triumph against injustice,” said Assemblymember Carrillo. “Today’s resolution is a reminder of our history, our strength, and our unity across communities.”
The resolution was brought forward with strong support from the California Latino Legislative Caucus, highlighting the Caucus’ commitment to honoring Latino history and recognizing the continued fight for equity.
During floor remarks, members from several legislative caucuses rose to express their strong support for HR 16:
With bipartisan and cross-caucus support, HR 16 was adopted, reinforcing the Assembly’s collective commitment to honoring Latino history and uplifting communities working toward justice and equity.
Cinco de Mayo commemorates the historic victory of Mexican forces over the French at the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862 a triumph that symbolizes the resilience and determination of the Mexican people in the face of adversity. The observance serves as a meaningful opportunity to celebrate the cultural heritage of the Latino community, while also reflecting on the deep historical ties between Mexico and the United States.

This resolution affirms the Legislature’s commitment to fostering mutual respect, shared values, and unity among all Californians. As Benito Juárez once said, “El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz” the respect for the rights of others is peace.

Juan Carillo,Assemblymember Carrillo’s Bill to Expand Housing Through Small ADUs and JADU’s Advances in State Legislature,2025-04-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assembly Bill 1154, authored by Assemblymember Juan Carrillo (D- Palmdale) in collaboration with California YIMBY, passed the Assembly Floor with bipartisan support. This passage marks an important step toward making it easier for California homeowners to build and rent small housing units. The bill seeks to bring greater parity between small Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and Junior Accessory Dwelling Units (JADUs), helping increase the state’s housing supply while supporting low- and middle-income families.
“California needs more housing—and small units like ADUs and JADUs are an essential part of the solution,” said Assemblymember Carrillo. “This bill makes smart, targeted updates that will empower more homeowners to create affordable housing in their own communities. Adjusting JADU and ADU law creates more parity between the two. This will help incentivize homeowners to use these units as a tool to build wealth while also increasing the amount of housing units on the market. This is a win for both the homeowners and people looking to find affordable housing available throughout California.”
AB 1154 proposes two key updates to streamline housing development: it eliminates the owner-occupancy requirement for Junior Accessory Dwelling Units (JADUs) that have their own sanitation facilities, and exempts small Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) under 500 square feet from parking requirements—aligning them with existing exemptions for JADUs.
“California needs more housing, and AB 1154 is part of the solution. This bill streamlines the development of Accessory Dwelling Units and Junior Accessory Dwelling Units, cuts costs, and helps put more homes on the market,” said Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis. “I am proud to co-sponsor this bill and grateful to Assemblymember Juan Carrillo for his leadership in tackling our housing crisis.”
Between 2016 and 2022, over 80,000 ADUs were approved in California—a 15,000% increase. These units are helping ease the housing crisis by providing more options for renters while offering homeowners opportunities to build wealth, increase property value, and generate income. However, current law treats ADUs and JADUs inconsistently, often subjecting the smaller JADUs to more restrictive rules.
As co-sponsors in support of the bill, California YIMBY CEO, Brian Hanlon says, ""Making it fast and easy for homeowners to build small apartments within their existing homes is one of the best ways to expand housing supply while providing urgently-needed, lower-cost homes for Californians. We applaud Assemblymember Carrillo for his commitment to helping California's homeowners be a part of the solution to our housing shortage and affordability crisis with AB 1154.”
The bill moves to the Senate and is now pending referral to the next policy committee. For more information contact Ruby Arceo at Ruby.Arceo@asm.ca.gov

Juan Carillo,Latino Caucus Tour Wraps Up with Press Conference Highlighting AD 39’s Economic Growth and Legislative Support,2025-04-11,press_release,NA,"Palmdale, CA – Today, Assemblymember Juan Carrillo hosted a press conference at his Palmdale District Office to wrap up the Latino Caucus Tour, showcasing the economic potential and legislative priorities of Assembly District 39. This press conference served as an opportunity to reflect on the last two days of the tour for the Latino Caucus and highlight the key takeaways from the event, as well as the essential work local organizations are doing to support the region’s growth.
Assemblymember Juan Carrillo was joined by Senator Bob Archuleta, Board member Antonio Vazquez (Board of Equalization), Mayor Richard Loa (City of Palmdale), Arthur Sohikian (Executive Director of the North County Transportation Coalition), John Smelzer (Founder and President of AV Alta FC), Assemblymember Carrillo spoke about the importance of the Latino Caucus’ continued commitment to the region. “Over the past two days, we’ve had the opportunity to bring together over Seven Latino Caucus members who visited our region to engage directly with the unique challenges and opportunities we face in the Antelope Valley, High Desert, and Victor Valley,” said Carrillo. “The tour has been invaluable in helping us better understand the diverse needs of our communities and work toward legislative solutions that promote economic growth and equity.”
Senator Bob Archuleta, a member of the Latino Caucus, emphasized the significance of collaboration across regions. “California continues to lead in innovation that much is clear with our visit to Plant 42. Not only is it a beacon of California’s role in developing cutting edge technology, it is a testament to the importance of industry to our local economies. It is also clear, now more than ever, that we must protect our families and most vulnerable communities. Communities cannot prosper when parents are afraid to leave their homes, when they fear going to work because they may not come back to their kids. We need to ensure people can go to work, provide for their families, and help local economies thrive”
Arthur Sohikian of the North County Transportation Coalition highlighted vital infrastructure projects like the High Desert Corridor and SR-14 improvements, which are integral to regional mobility and growth. “Our transportation initiatives will significantly enhance connectivity and job opportunities, which are key to the success of AD 39,” Sohikian explained.
John Smelzer, Founder of AV Alta FC, shared how sports and community engagement are critical in fostering wellness and opportunity. “Through our programs, we’re building a healthier, more empowered community,” said Smelzer. “Public-private partnerships are essential in developing infrastructure that supports our youth and future leaders.”
The Latino Caucus Tour has brought together key legislators and local leaders to gain firsthand insight into the needs and opportunities across AD 39, which includes the cities of Palmdale, Lancaster, Victorville, Adelanto, and Hesperia. The tour’s goal was to strengthen collaboration among state lawmakers and local stakeholders to support policies that foster economic development, improve infrastructure, and ensure equity for all communities.
Assemblymember Carrillo closed the event by reinforcing the importance of continued partnership and advocacy: “We will continue to work with local organizations, industries, and community leaders to ensure that AD 39 remains a hub for growth and opportunity, where the state government listens and acts to support all residents.”

Juan Carillo,California Legislators Take Aggressive Steps to Combat Rising Retail Theft,2024-10-16,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, CA – The California Legislature has been actively addressing the growing issues of retail theft and property crime, which have surged in recent years, particularly in urban areas. In 2024, the Legislature acted decisively to combat this alarming trend, rapidly convening hearings to find solutions and ultimately passing a package of new laws designed to allocate resources effectively and crack down on these crimes.
One of the most significant actions was the creation of the Select Committee on Retail Theft. This committee, alongside the Committee on Public Safety, focused on assessing the root causes of organized retail theft and formulating strategies to curb it. The committee held regular hearings to gather expert testimony, hear from affected businesses, and consider policy adjustments.
The Legislature quickly translated study into comprehensive action, passing 11 bipartisan bills related to combatting organized retail theft during the 2024 session. These bills take a comprehensive approach that includes increased time behind bars for certain crimes, enhanced tools for law enforcement to charge and prosecute offenders, and disruption of criminals’ ability to sell stolen goods online.
Our work also reiterates the importance of continuing to invest in preventive strategies. The new laws combatting retail theft also contain provisions to address the socio-economic factors that contribute to theft, including poverty, unemployment, and inadequate mental health services.
In addition to policy adjustments, the Legislature has established targeted grant programs. The Organized Retail Theft (ORT) Vertical Prosecution Grant Program was created to help local prosecutors develop specialized teams to address complex theft cases involving organized crime syndicates. This initiative, part of Assembly Bill 178, aims to dismantle the criminal networks driving large-scale retail theft. It provides local law enforcement and prosecutors financial support to enhance their operations, tackle persistent theft rings, and prosecute offenders.
California's legislative approach to retail theft is multi-faceted and balanced, involving prosecutorial support, policy adjustments, and broader social reforms. By allocating resources to combat organized retail theft, the Legislature aims to protect businesses while ensuring that justice is fair and effective. Our actions this year demonstrate that effective policy can be made through collaboration, unity, and responsiveness to the needs of Californians.
For more information about these new laws or to schedule an interview, please contact Brenda Contreras at brenda.contreras@asm.ca.gov or (916) 319-2039.

Juan Carillo,AB2929 - Providing Stability and Support for Vulnerable Children,2024-10-04,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, CA – Assemblymember Juan Carrillo released the following statement regarding the passage of AB 2929:
“I want to express my gratitude to Governor Newsom for signing AB 2929, a new law that sends a strong message about our state’s commitment to providing stability and support for vulnerable children who deserve every opportunity for success,” said Assemblymember Juan Carrillo. “Studies have shown that children in our welfare system who are placed with relatives are more likely to excel in school, maintain a steady career, and have a more secure sense of self-identity and belonging.”
“AB 2929 promotes equal access to updates on family finding efforts from social workers to improve the overall well-being of foster youth children by requiring existing documentation of family finding efforts to be included in court reports for review hearings. Documentation of these efforts is necessary to ensure that all parties involved in a child welfare case have the information necessary to facilitate these meaningful connections.
“Within my district, there are thousands of children residing in foster care and the passage of AB 2929 is a crucial step toward enhancing their familial connections and providing them with the supportive environments they need to thrive.”

Juan Carillo,AB 2192,2024-10-01,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, CA – Assemblymember Juan Carrillo released the following statement regarding the passage of AB 2192:
“I want to thank Governor Newsom for signing AB 2192, a new law that will reduce administrative burdens on public agencies that voluntarily participate in the California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act by adjusting current bidding limits for inflation and the rising costs of construction,” said Assemblymember Juan Carrillo. “This will help us promote uniformity and fairness in cost accounting standards for construction work performed or contracted.
“By making it easier for public agencies to build efficiently, we can accelerate the construction of affordable housing and infrastructure that our communities desperately need. AB 2192 is a key step toward addressing California's housing shortage while improving our public works projects statewide.”

Juan Carillo,AB 2109,2024-10-01,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, CA – Assemblymember Juan Carrillo released the following statement regarding the passage of AB 2109:
“I applaud Governor Newsom for his support of AB 2109, a new law that will help achieve California’s climate goals by encouraging investment in Industrial Process Heat Recovery (IPHR) technologies,” said Assemblymember Juan Carrillo. “AB 2109 would treat IHPR as energy efficiency in California, and will encourage new investment in zero-carbon IPHR technology, keeping good paying jobs and clean manufacturing throughout the state.
It is critical for California to identify and remove hurdles to decarbonize industry sectors to abate the effects of climate change. With the cement industry mandated to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, it is important to utilize the tools at hand and this bill does just that. This bill will allow these industries to capture this heat and create carbon free electricity and will increase reliability of the state’s electricity grid by reducing load during times of grid stress.
AB 2109 sends a powerful message about our commitment to innovative, forward-thinking solutions that promote sustainability and combat climate to advance California’s goals.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and Members of the Legislature Call on Governor Newsom to Take Immediate Action as Chiquita Canyon Landfill Fire Triples to 90 Acres,2025-04-23,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – In response to the growing public health emergency at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill fire, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and 30 members of the State Legislature sent a formal letter to Governor Gavin Newsom today requesting immediate support for residents impacted by toxic and cancer-causing emissions from the burning landfill.
According to CalEPA’s most recent update, the reaction area at Chiquita Canyon Landfill has tripled in size and now threatens the release of hazardous leachate. The fire continues to release methane, hydrogen sulfide, and nearly two dozen known carcinogens. Residents report debilitating symptoms including nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations, multiple miscarriages, death of otherwise healthy family pets, and prolonged nosebleeds, one so severe it led to ER hospitalization after the resident began bleeding from her eyes. Some families are taking refuge in their cars, sleeping with their family in parking lots farther from the landfill.
The letter calls for a change in strategy beyond only monitoring air quality and tracking symptoms, and urges Governor Newsom to provide direct assistance to families being made sick by the burning landfill, including relocation aid, healthcare support, and tax relief, while the ongoing lawsuit and regulatory proceedings move forward.
“For over three years, families living near the Chiquita Canyon Landfill have endured toxic exposure from an underground fire that has recently tripled in size and that officials now expect to burn for decades,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “We cannot ask these families to wait for a lawsuit to play out while their kids breathe cancer-causing chemicals every single day. Some community members are so sick they have become unable to work, even losing homes. This is a health emergency, and the state must act like it.”
The landfill’s community relief program was abruptly terminated in February 2025, leaving residents without financial help, which already was barely covering the basics and did not include relocation or other key assistance. Without intervention, thousands of families may be forced to live with long-term toxic exposure and its life-altering consequences for decades.
The letter urges the Governor to take the following actions to provide both short-term and long-term relief:
“Much like the Aliso Canyon disaster a decade ago, this situation demands an emergency response,” added Assemblywoman Schiavo. “The symptoms, chemical exposure, and scale of the public health threat are even greater now, and yet the response doesn’t match that urgency, and public health is not being protected. That must change.”
The letter to the Governor can be read in full here.
Assemblywoman Schiavo and the Los Angeles County Legislative Delegation sent a similar letter to the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, calling for immediate local action. If appropriate steps are not taken by the County, the letter urges Governor Newsom to direct the California Department of Public Health to step in and provide the protections residents desperately need.

Schiavo Delivers Letter to Board of Supervisor Urging Immediate Action
LOS ANGELES, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo led a formal letter with the Los Angeles County Legislative Delegation (LACD) today, delivering it to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors urging immediate and robust public health action to address the growing crisis at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. After state legislators learned last month that the landfill fire had tripled in size from 30 to 90 acres of burning trash, and is now expected to burn for multiple decades. LA County is the Lead Enforcement Agency over the landfill, so the letter calls on the Board and LA County Department of Public Health to take decisive steps to protect the health and safety of residents in Val Verde, Castaic, and Santa Clarita impacted by the underground fire burning at the landfill.
Assemblywoman Schiavo will join community members impacted by the landfill fire for a press conference today at 11:00 am at 500 W. Temple Street in Los Angeles, before going into the Board of Supervisors meeting to provide public comment where she will deliver the letter in person and request urgent action.
The fire burning at the landfill is resulting in exposure to hazardous chemicals like methane, hydrogen sulfide, and cancer-causing toxins like acrolein and benzene. Residents have reported headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, dizziness, heart palpitations, vomiting, breathing difficulties, and even tremors. Others have been diagnosed with and died from cancer.
“Residents are suffering every single day from severe health impacts due to toxic exposure, and they have been for years,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “With the fire now tripling in size to 90 acres and expected to burn for multiple decades, this is no longer a slow-moving crisis. It’s an emergency, and the response for neighbors being made sick must reflect that. Our communities deserve the same level of urgency, action, and care that was provided in past disasters like Aliso Canyon or the other Los Angeles Fires.”
The letter, signed by 22 members of the Los Angeles County Legislative Delegation, compares the severity of the current crisis to the 2015 Aliso Canyon gas storage facility leak, also in Assembly District 40, and outlines a detailed roadmap for the Department of Public Health to follow, including the implementation of a comprehensive CASPER door to door health study, increased public information, community engagement, and an order requiring relocation support for the most impacted residents and home hardening for other neighbors.
Lawmakers also requested that the Board declare a local State of Emergency, citing the urgent need for additional resources and protection. If such a declaration is not made, the letter calls for alternative relief options, including mortgage forbearance and property tax transfer and reassessments for affected homeowners.
Among the actions requested in the letter:
The letter highlights the alarming comparison between Chiquita Canyon Landfill crisis and the Aliso Canyon gas leak, noting that the County’s response then—including relocation orders—was based on far fewer health complaints and lower toxic gas readings than currently being reported at Chiquita Canyon. Since April 2023, over 28,000 odor and symptom complaints have been submitted to the South Coast Air Quality Management District—more than 20,000% higher than the number filed during the early days of Aliso Canyon.
“Our communities deserve a response based on the symptoms they are experiencing, which are serious, urgent, and for some, could be life-long and life threatening,” Assemblywoman Schiavo added. “We are demanding the County act with the urgency and humanity this crisis demands and our community is treated no differently than others in LA County with similar impacts on health. After three years of a burning landfill, at a certain point this lack of response to protect public health becomes negligent.”
The letter is attached to be viewed in its entirety and can be viewed here.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Introduces Legislation Focused on Affordability and Lowering Costs,2025-04-10,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Today, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced a package of bills focused on affordability and lowering costs. This bill package is aimed at putting money back in the pockets of working families, protecting seniors, removing barriers to accessing healthcare, and holding corporations accountable, including the Chiquita Canyon Tax Relief Act (AB 27), Senior Fraud Reimbursement Act (AB 909), Ratepayer Relief Act (AB 1020), Timely Care Act (AB 539), Click to Cancel 2.0 (AB 656), and Social Security and Medicare Protection Resolutions (AJR 3/AJR 8), Police Pension Tax Exemption Bill (AB 814), Veterans Pension Tax Exemption Bill (AB 53, and Veterans’ Property Tax Exemption (ACA 5).
“In every part of my district I hear from people who are doing everything right and still struggling to pay for the basics,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “These bills fight back against corporate red tape, against fraud targeting our seniors, against rising utility bills, and help people keep more of what they earn. We are taking real action to put money back in people’s pockets and make life more affordable.”
Chiquita Canyon Tax Relief Act (AB 27)
The Chiquita Canyon Tax Relief Act ensures that any compensation residents receive, whether from the landfill operator or a government entity, is exempt from state income taxes and excluded from calculations that affect eligibility for public benefits. This bill ensures that impacted residents can receive the full relief they are entitled to without fear of losing access to essential resources. 
Veterans Pension Tax Exemption Bill (AB 53)
The Veterans Pension Tax Exemption Bill takes a significant step toward recognizing the sacrifices of our military veterans and their families by eliminating state income taxes on military retirement pay beginning in 2027. It also extends that exemption to recipients of the Department of Defense’s Survivor Benefits Program, ensuring surviving spouses and dependents are not penalized for the loss of a loved one in service. 
Police Pension Tax Exemption Bill (AB 814)
Too many retired peace officers are being priced out of California, despite having spent their careers protecting our communities. The Police Pension Tax Exemption Bill honors the service and sacrifice of these individuals by exempting peace officer pensions from state income tax, helping to ensure they can afford to remain in the neighborhoods they served. 
Veterans’ Property Tax Exemption (ACA 5)
ACA 5 is a constitutional amendment that expands access to veterans’ and disabled veterans’ property tax exemptions, helping to make homeownership more affordable for those who have served. Currently, veterans cannot claim both the homeowners’ exemption and the veterans’ exemption. ACA 5 would remove this restriction, allowing eligible veterans to benefit from both exemptions. It also eliminates an outdated property value cap and authorizes the Legislature to increase the exemption amount in the future. This measure makes long-overdue changes to bring tax policy in line with today’s housing market, and in doing so, helps more veterans afford to stay in their homes.
Senior Fraud Reimbursement Act (AB 909)
The Senior Fraud Reimbursement Act protects victims of financial exploitation, especially seniors, by requiring banks and financial institutions to take proactive measures to prevent scams and to reimburse victims when those measures fail. This bill brings urgently needed accountability to protect one of our most vulnerable populations.
Social Security and Medicare Protection Resolutions (AJR 3 / AJR 8)
These resolutions call on Congress and the President to uphold and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, reject any effort to cut orpprivatize these programs, and invest in better service for the millions of Californians. With over 6 million Californians receiving Social Security benefits and just under 7 million Californans who rely on Medicare, these resolutions reaffirm our commitment to preserving this foundational program for current and future generations. 
Timely Care Act (AB 539)
The Timely Care Act improves healthcare access by extending prior authorizations for care from 60 or 90 days to one full year. Delays in care caused by slow administrative processes can worsen conditions and lead to more expensive treatments or additional hospital visits. Especially for people with chronic health conditions, repetitive approvals waste time and money. Eliminating these unnecessary fights with insurers or extra medical appointments helps both patients and doctors focus on health, not paperwork.
Utility Ratepayer Relief Act (AB 1020)
As utility rates skyrocket, the Ratepayer Relief Act ensures that savings from public grants or low-interest government loans are passed directly to ratepayers, not hoarded by investor-owned utilities. With nearly 20% of Californians behind on their energy bills, this bill promotes transparency and empowers the Public Utilities Commission to enforce compliance and penalize utility companies that fail to pass on savings.
These measures reflect Assemblywoman Schiavo’s continued commitment to delivering real relief from the rising cost of living which is making life harder for millions of families. This legislative package brings meaningful, common-sense solutions to the affordability challenges faced by hard-working people every day.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Yesterday, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s bill, the Expediting State Housing Permits Act (AB 301) was passed as part of a major package of housing legislation aimed at tackling the state’s housing crisis. The bill streamlines the state permitting process and eliminates avoidable delays that slow down housing construction. Growing our housing stock more quickly and efficiently is a key piece of our efforts to make housing more affordable and available.
“In the middle of a housing crisis, it’s crucial we pull all the levers available to us to build more housing faster and that’s affordable. We can’t let bureaucracy needlessly delay these desperately needed housing projects,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “The Expediting State Housing Permits Act holds state agencies accountable to the same deadlines as local governments, so that families aren’t stuck waiting for what can be as simple as a state agency sign off.”
The goal of the Expediting State Housing Permits Act is to break down barriers to building more housing, which in the end will create more housing stock and lead to more housing that’s affordable. The bill aligns state review timelines with those already required of counties for completeness checks and permit approvals. If a state agency fails to meet the required deadlines, the permit is deemed approved or the review considered complete, removing one of the most frustrating roadblocks to getting housing built.

“We're tackling the housing crisis so that California can again be a place where new homes are built quickly, because housing supply is a key driver of overall affordability for families,” said Speaker Robert Rivas, who is joint authoring the Expediting State Housing Permits Act (AB 301). “The Assembly’s fast action on these housing bills is a key step toward reducing construction delays and cost overruns”
The legislation passed the Assembly with strong support and is now headed to the State Senate for consideration. The Expediting State Housing Permits Act is part of a broader legislative housing package of nine bills being expedited by the State Assembly that includes bills to accelerate local building reviews, temporarily pause costly new building standards, and help prevent homelessness, among others.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Joins Impacted Residents to Demand Action on Chiquita Canyon Landfill Crisis as Disaster Grows,2025-03-27,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Today, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo joined a press conference on the West Steps of the State Capitol, organized by community members from Val Verde, Castaic, and the Santa Clarita Valley, to call attention to the growing public health disaster at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill.
Impacted residents raised the alarm about the worsening underground fire at the landfill, now growing from 30 to 90 acres, and urged support for legislative and budget solutions to help community members suffering daily from exposure to toxic gasses.
“As Assemblywoman, it is my job to do all I can to keep our community safe, which is why I will never stop fighting for the families impacted by this growing disaster,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “This landfill is making people sick with cancer, tremors and ER visits just to be able to breathe - and it’s now expected to continue to do so for decades. We need urgent action, real accountability, and resources to help residents who are living through this public health disaster every single day.”
The Chiquita Canyon Landfill, which has been burning underground since 2022, has more than tripled in size and continues to release toxic gases, prompting respiratory issues, nosebleeds, cancer clusters, and environmental damage. Constituents who joined today’s press conference shared firsthand accounts of the toll this disaster has taken on their health and livelihoods, underscoring the urgent need for a direct relief.
“This is not just about a landfill, this is about the air we breathe and the health of our families, and the responsibility really of the people who are in charge who are supposed to serve and protect us,” said community member Elizabeth Jeffords. “The Chiquita Canyon Landfill has been poisoning our air for far too long, we suffer every single day. We need help immediately.”
To ensure relief for impacted residents, Assemblywoman Schiavo has introduced legislation to exempt compensation from either the landfill or government from being taxed or counted against public benefits (AB 27), and to ensure long-term oversight and accountability of the landfill (AB 28). She has also submitted budget proposals to provide $25 million in relocation assistance and long-term support for affected families. These measures aim to bring urgently needed relief to communities who have suffered for far too long.

Pilar Schiavo,"Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Advances Public Safety, Victim Protections, and Small Business Safety with Key Legislative Efforts",2025-03-17,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Demonstrating her commitment to public safety, including protecting victims and small businesses, and supporting law enforcement officers, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo has introduced critical legislation aimed at strengthening public and community safety. The legislative package includes the Victim and Witness Protection Act (AB 535), Small Business Retail Theft Grants (AB 949), Police Pension Tax Exemption (AB 814), and protecting funding for crime victims (VOCA Funding Ask) in the State budget.
“Everyone in our community - from small business owners, to victims and witnesses of crime, to law enforcement officers who dedicate their lives to keeping us safe - deserve our support. These bills will go a long way to ensuring we are keeping people and our small business safe and giving law enforcement the ability to thrive,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “As a Member of the Select Committee on Retail Theft, the representative of a large law enforcement community who work to keep us safe and should be able to retire with dignity, and a victim of crime myself, the responsibility to protect our community is one I take very seriously. These bills move forward important protections and supports to make that real.”

Victim and Witness Protection Act (AB 535)
The Victim and Witness Protection Act strengthens legal protections for victims and witnesses, ensuring their safety before and after criminal charges are filed. By providing essential safeguards, this measure empowers victims—particularly survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking—to seek justice without fear of intimidation or retaliation. This bill eliminates a legal barrier that victims currently face seeking protection from intimidation. This Act will provide an extra layer of protection for survivors and witnesses to assist law enforcement with the vital information needed to solve crimes, support survivors, and ensure our communities are safe.
Small Business Retail Theft Grants (AB 949)
As small businesses and independent retailers have recently faced a retail theft crisis, this bill establishes the Small Business Retail Theft Grant Program to provide financial resources to small businesses to purchase needed security improvements. From investing in surveillance equipment to reinforcing store safety measures, this bill ensures that small businesses - the backbone of our economy - can protect their livelihoods and contribute to safer communities.
Police Pension Tax Exemption (AB 814)
California’s high cost of living and tax burdens have driven many retired law enforcement officers to leave the state, taking their experience and knowledge with them. The Police Pension Tax Exemption Bill supports the retention of retired peace officers by exempting law enforcement pensions from state income tax between 2025 and 2030. After dedicating their lives to serving our community and helping to ensure our safety, this bill helps to honor that service.
Victims of Crime Program Funding Request
The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Fund is a crucial resource for organizations aiding survivors of domestic violence, elder abuse, and human trafficking. As federal funding for these programs declines, Assemblywoman Schiavo is leading an effort to backfill lost funding to ensure these life-saving services remain available.
Together, these measures reflect Assemblywoman Schiavo’s commitment to safer communities—where victims and witnesses of crime are protected, small businesses are supported, and law enforcement officers receive the financial stability they deserve.

Pilar Schiavo,Legislators Join Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo for Tour of Chiquita Canyon Landfill Fire and Call for Urgent Action for Growing Disaster,2025-03-14,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.

SANTA CLARITA, CA – Today, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo, alongside a delegation of state legislators, community leaders, and impacted residents, toured the Eaton fire recovery areas in Los Angeles and the burning Chiquita Canyon Landfill, raising alarm over the escalating growing disaster that has caused a public health crisis. The group convened for a response briefing by state agencies and joined impacted community members for a roundtable before holding a press conference at Castaic Community AME Church to call for additional urgent action in response to the worsening conditions at the landfill—the only fire still burning in Los Angeles County.
The landfill fire, which has been burning for years, more than doubled in size, expanding from an estimated 40 acres to over 90 acres. News broke of this major expansion of the underground fire just this week when CAL EPA reported updated temperature tracking data recently received from the landfill. During the tour, residents described worsening health issues from dangerous toxins in the air, respiratory issues, a possible cancer cluster and other health concerns, while legislators underscored the need for stronger oversight and emergency response measures from the state and county.
“This fire is a dangerous public health emergency that has gone on for far too long,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “Our communities deserve safe living conditions—not ongoing exposure to toxic fumes that are making them sick. I stand with our community to demand accountability, resources, and urgent action in a long overdue state of emergency to protect families who have been suffering for years now.”
Joining Schiavo on the tour were Majority Leader Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, Assemblymember John Harabedian, Assemblymember Steve Bennett, Assemblymember Stephanie Nguyen, Assemblymember Gail Pellerin, and Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez.
""It’s unacceptable that families, especially our children, have been forced to breathe toxic air for years while waiting for government action. This isn’t an issue exclusive to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. Air quality is a statewide concern that demands increased county, state, and federal intervention,” said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry. “Big picture, we need stronger statewide protections and emergency response plans to protect our communities and their kids from these kinds of disasters. We need to do better, because Californians deserve real solutions so we can breathe clean air.""
""Seeing the devastation caused by the burning Chiquita Canyon Landfill firsthand, I was struck by how families are facing exposure to toxins, serious health risks, and uncertainty about how or when they will fully recover.” said Assemblymember John Harabedian. “As we’ve seen in responding to and recovering from the Eaton Fire, a robust, coordinated response makes a real difference in protecting lives and getting communities the help they need. That's exactly what we need here-aggressive action to contain the fire, ensure accountability, protect public health and provide relief for impacted residents.""
Community members, many of whom live near the landfill, shared firsthand accounts of respiratory problems, persistent odors, rare cancers and possible cancer clusters leading to community fears about long-term exposure to hazardous emissions.
""Our community is so grateful that Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and other elected officials are taking this situation seriously. Our community desperately needs help and fast. The underground fire at Chiquita Canyon Landfill, which has now doubled in size, is making residents very sick. I am deeply concerned for the health of my family, my neighbors, and the people at nearby schools and businesses.” said Jennifer Elkins, a Val Verde resident who lives near the landfill. “The landfill has failed this community, LA county has failed this community, and so now we look to our elected officials for help. We need our government to take action to protect the people and stop this environmental disaster before it gets worse.""
In addition to advancing legislation that would bring financial relief for residents, Assemblywoman Schiao continues to gather support from legislative colleagues to find other avenues at the state level to help the residents of Val Verde and Castaic find relief from the burning landfill. One of those avenues is a bill authored by Assemblywoman Schiavo that would make any compensation received by residents from Chiquita Canyon Landfill exempt from state taxes and excluded from counting against those who qualify for state assistance such as CalFresh. She also has a bill requesting funding, through the state budget, to assist residents with short or long-term relocation expenses, offering the necessary financial support to those who have no other option than to escape their community due to ongoing and severe health and environmental impacts and illnesses.

Until a state of emergency is declared, some relief continues to be unavailable to our community, such as possible mortgage and property tax relief, FEMA support, and more.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Condemns Proposed Federal Cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs that Put Veteran Lives at Risk,2025-03-06,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
In response to proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs by the federal administration, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo issued the following statement, and is available for press interviews after the legislative session today or by phone and video.
“This week, my father died as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. Actions by the federal administration to make cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) directly puts veterans like my dad in danger. As Chair of the Assembly Military and Veterans Affairs Committee, the daughter and sister of veterans, and an Assemblywoman representing a community with a large veteran population, I am furious and deeply concerned by the VA cuts being proposed by the federal administration.
Let’s be clear: cutting staff at the VA means cutting services and healthcare for veterans. There’s no way around it. The PACT Act, finally signed into law in 2022, meant some veterans made sick from Agent Orange or burn pits would finally have access to care and support that was previously denied from the VA. The influx of those new patients meant the VA needed to increase staff, and they still faced a backlog. To cut staff, just a couple of years later, is a slap in the face of those veterans who fought for their right to care after sacrificing so much for our country.
Such deep cuts to the Department's workforce threatens veteran lives. Period. These cuts have the potential to cause irreversible and widespread damage to veterans across the country, including right here in California. In addition to 27% of the Department's workforce being veterans themselves, facing possible unemployment from this reckless political action, veterans and their families stand to lose access to vital and life-saving services like healthcare, mental health access, and the ability to speak to someone at the Veterans Crisis Hotline.
It is unconscionable that this administration would put the very people who risked their lives to protect us unnecessarily in harm's way, when what they deserve is our protection and support. I will fight everyday to ensure our veterans and their families have the services they need to thrive, which includes calling on the federal administration to swiftly reverse these cuts and leading solutions in California to support and protect veterans.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Leads Call for Protecting Healthcare Funding,2025-03-04,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Today, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo (D-Los Angeles) led a press conference at the State Capitol urging the federal government to protect funding for Social Security, Medicare, and Medi-Cal as part of Assembly Joint Resolution 3 (AJR 3). The resolution calls on the federal government to reject proposed cuts to Medi-Cal and prevent any future reductions to Medicare or Social Security, which would have devastating consequences for patients, families, and service providers across California.
Joined by Assemblymember Dr. Jasmeet Bains (D-Delano), healthcare advocates, service providers, and veterans’ representatives, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo emphasized the urgent need for federal action to prevent cuts and restrictions that could harm millions of families.
""No one should have to worry about losing access to healthcare, especially our seniors, veterans, and working families who have paid into these programs and rely on them,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “We’re standing together to send a clear message: protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medi-Cal, because people’s lives depend on it.""
Speakers shared firsthand accounts of how federal healthcare policies impact their lives, their patients, and their communities, underscoring the need for stronger protections and continued investment in these programs.
""As a Community Health Center, Northeast Valley Health Corporation serves as a lifeline for tens of thousands of Californians who rely on Medi-Cal for essential healthcare services,"" said Kimberly Wyard, CEO of Northeast Valley Health Corporation. ""Proposed cuts to Medi-Cal would devastate our ability to provide primary and preventive care, impacting the most vulnerable in our communities—seniors, children, working families, and individuals with chronic conditions. These cuts wouldn’t just hurt patients; they would strain emergency rooms, increase long-term healthcare costs, and destabilize the very safety net our communities depend on. We applaud Assemblywoman Schiavo’s leadership in advocating for the protection of these critical programs, and we urge continued investment to ensure all Californians have access to the care they need.""
As AJR 3 moves forward, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and advocates will continue working with federal representatives to push for policies that protect and expand access to healthcare for California families. You can watch today's press release in its entirety here.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Requests Insurance Protections for Hughes Fire Survivors,2025-02-26,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
Santa Clarita, CA – In response to advocacy from Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s office, yesterday California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara expanded the mandatory one-year moratorium on homeowners insurance non-renewals and cancellations to include residents impacted by the Hughes Fire.
This critical protection prevents insurance providers from canceling or refusing to renew homeowners policies for one year due to wildfire risk, offering much-needed insurancestability and relief for families recovering from wildfire disasters.
It was announced in a release sent out by the California Insurance Commissioner's office that residents in the ZIP codes surrounding the Hughes Fire burn area are now covered under this crucial insurance moratorium. The ZIP codes include:
91354, 91355, 91381, 91383, 91384, 91390, 93040, 93222, 93225, 93243, 93532
Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s office took action after community reports that ZIP codes impacted by the Hughes Fire were not included in the Commissioner’s original moratorium order and insurers had dropped them.
“When we learned that Hughes Fire survivors weren’t covered under the insurance moratorium, we immediately took action, bringing this need to the Insurance Commissioner. I’m grateful for his responsiveness and for taking swift action. Our communities of Castaic, Val Verde and Santa Clarita have already been through so much, we must do everything we can to protect what is often the most important investment - your home,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “We will continue fighting to make sure our community gets the relief and protections they need to recover and rebuild.”
Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara added, ""Homeowners affected by the Hughes Fire and other devastating wildfires should not have to worry about losing their insurance coverage during this crisis. My moratorium powers ensure that insurers cannot cancel or refuse to renew policies for those in wildfire-impacted areas, providing much-needed stability and relief during this difficult time. My team and I are working tirelessly to protect consumers and help them receive the benefits they are entitled to as quickly as possible.""
If you are impacted by the Hughes Fire and have concerns about your insurance coverage, you can:
Call the California Department of Insurance: 1-800-927-4357

Assemblywoman Schiavo’s office remains committed to ensuring wildfire survivors receive the protections and assistance they need and deserve.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Announces 2025 Bill Package Focused on Affordability and Community Safety,2025-02-24,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo introduced a legislative package for the 2025 session, with 18 new bills tackling critical issues facing families in her district. The package of bills prioritizes affordability, community safety, housing and homelessness, and more. Today, she announced three bills in the package, aimed at helping to solve our housing and homelessness crisis, including speeding up housing construction, improving housing stability for foster youth, and helping prevent medical debt from leading to homelessness.
“We need to take bold action to tackle the challenges our community is facing—from the housing affordability crisis to financial hardships that push people further into instability,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “These bills are about cutting red tape, expediting action, providing real support for families, and making sure people have the foundation they need to thrive.”
Expediting State Housing Permits ensures that housing projects are not stalled by removing red tape and establishing firm timelines for state agencies involved in housing development reviews. The bill requires state agencies to follow the same timelines required of counties for completeness checks and permit approvals. If a state agency fails to meet these deadlines, the permit will be deemed approved, or the review period will be considered complete, allowing housing development to move forward without roadblocks or further delays.
The Patient Debt Prevention Act reduces medical costs by requiring hospitals to prescreen patients experiencing homelessness, uninsured patients, Medi-Cal recipients, and those with over $500 in medical debt for eligibility to charity care or reduced-cost programs before they are discharged. This ensures that patients receive the financial assistance they qualify for and prevents hospitals from burdening families currently struggling financially with unaffordable bills and medical debt, especially at a time when they may still be recovering from serious illness.

“Californians should not avoid hospital care out of fear they can’t pay the bill. No family should struggle to pay off avoidable hospital debt as a parent or child is recovering from an illness,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “For too long, patients have been in the dark about financial assistance, even though financial help for hospital bills is available. Now, we have the tools to quickly estimate patients’ eligibility for financial assistance and help them apply for relief before they ever receive a hospital bill. The Patient Debt Prevention Act ensures hospital patients get the help they need to afford care, not a call from a collection agent.”
Foster Youth Housing Stability helps foster youth service providers that support transition-age youth to more reliably access private financing to purchase housing. By amending Transitional Housing Program contracts, the bill decreases the risk of investment and increases the availability of stable, long-term housing for youth exiting foster care, reducing homelessness among this vulnerable population.
These three bills will be heard in policy committees in the coming months, with opportunities for stakeholders and the public to provide input. Individuals and organizations can submit position letters here.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Takes Action to Protect California’s Tax Dollars and Essential Services,2025-02-03,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO, CA – In response to recent federal actions that puts affordability, public safety, and many essential services at risk, today Assemblywoman Schiavo stood firm in her oath to protect and defend the constitution and her commitment to protect Californian’s safety and hard earned tax dollars.
“Families in our district and across California work hard and pay their fair share in taxes, with the expectation that those dollars will help fund the programs and services we all rely on,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “But now, the critical federal funding we paid for and rely on is at risk of being withheld, which could have real and wide-ranging consequences for our schools, housing, wildfire recovery and prevention efforts, veterans' services, seniors meals, police and sheriff staffing, and more. That’s why today, I voted to protect our community. It’s critical that California has the resources we need to defend hardworking families from threats that impact affordability, safety and security.”
The impact of withholding of our tax dollars put the following at risk:
“Regardless of political party, the hard-working people in our community did not vote for higher grocery prices, school and law-enforcement cuts, or seniors and veterans pushed into homelessness,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “Make no mistake: there is no one who I won’t stand up to in order to protect you, your family, your safety, and your hard earned money, and actions we took today give us the ability to do just that.”
To safeguard the billions in state tax dollars and essential services, Assemblywoman Schiavo supported two key bills today:
“Our community faces immense challenges—from rising costs to devastating wildfires. Now more than ever, we need to ensure that we have safeguards in place to protect California families, their tax dollars, and their future,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “While we always hope to work collaboratively with our federal partners, I will not hesitate to take action when the rights of Californians are threatened or when our state’s resources are unjustly withheld. Californians can count on me to fight for their safety, their wallets, and their futures.”

PASADENA, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today joined with a bipartisan coalition of state and local leaders as Governor Newsom signed a package of bills directing $2.5 billion toward wildfire relief, rebuilding, and recovery.
The bills take effect immediately, delivering urgently needed funding and streamlining the rebuilding process for communities devastated by the Southern California wildfires. Assemblywoman Schiavo, who voted for the measures today, highlighted the importance of this swift action to provide relief to impacted families throughout the region.
“This historic investment will help families rebuild faster and ensure that state agencies act with the same urgency as local governments,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “With billions in funding and new accountability measures, we are making sure communities have the resources they need to recover and rebuild. There is a long road ahead for those impacted and we will be here to support those impacted every step of the way”
In addition to supporting the Wildfire Recovery Package, Assemblywoman Schiavo introduced an additional piece of legislation (AB 301) - alongside Joint Author Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas - a key bill in the broader Assembly wildfire and housing package.
“Families shouldn’t be stuck in bureaucratic limbo when they’re trying to rebuild their homes,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “The legislation we introduced today (AB 301) streamlines state permitting and ensures communities can move forward without red tape slowing them down. This type of action will make for a speedier recovery and rebuilding effort, which is the least we can do for the families impacted by this unimaginable devastation.”
AB 301 is currently awaiting committee assignment.

Sacramento, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo has been reappointed by Speaker Robert Rivas to the Utilities & Energy Committee, Health Committee, and continues as Chair of Military & Veteran Affairs Committee. She has also been newly appointed to the Banking and Finance Committee and the Budget Committee, including the budget subcommittee focused on health.
In response to the announcement, Assemblywoman Schiavo released the following statement:
""Californians are struggling with the rising costs of housing, insurance, utilities, and more. Over the last two years, I have worked alongside my colleagues to shape policies that tackle the affordability crisis in California, and there’s so much more work to do.
Through the Utilities and Energy Committee, I look forward to continuing efforts to reduce utility rates. And, building on the impact of 'Click-to-Cancel' (AB 2863) from the last legislative session, I’m excited for new opportunities on the Banking and Finance Committee to help consumers and protect your pocketbook.
As a former nurse advocate and with my continued role on the Health Committee and my new position on the Budget Committee and health subcommittee, I will keep working to reduce healthcare costs for families across California. I will also continue my work to protect access to critical services like maternity care, abortion care, and assistance programs to help everyone get the healthcare they need without cost being a barrier to care.”

Santa Clarita, CA – As wildfires and hurricane force winds continue to devastate Southern California, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo, Chair of the Committee on Military and Veteran Affairs, expressed her gratitude to the California National Guard (Cal Guard) for their swift and robust support in the fight against the growing fires. The Assemblywoman emphasized the critical role of Cal Guard in supplementing Cal FIRE’s efforts to protect lives, property, and natural resources across the region.

Nearly 180,000 residents have been evacuated, with an additional 200,000 under evacuation warnings. Tragically, five lives have been lost, with further injuries reported. Economic losses are estimated to range in the billions.
In response to this crisis, Cal Guard has mobilized significant resources to assist in firefighting and law enforcement operations:
“The bravery and dedication of the Cal Guard, Cal FIRE, and all of our first responders cannot be overstated,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “Fighting fires in the face of hurricane force winds is nearly impossible. Their efforts are saving lives, protecting homes, and ensuring the safety of our communities during this critical time. My office is here as a resource to those affected by these devastating fires.”
Assemblywoman Schiavo reiterated her commitment to supporting legislation and securing resources to bolster California’s wildfire response capabilities. Her office continues to monitor the situation closely and is ready to assist displaced residents and affected communities.
Southern California is facing an unprecedented wildfire season, with five major fires burning thousands of acres:

Pilar Schiavo,Statement from Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo on the Closure of Chiquita Canyon Landfill,2024-12-31,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
VAL VERDE, CA – In response to the Chiquita Canyon, LLC letter issued today announcing Chiquita Canyon Landfill will stop active trash disposal, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo released the following statement.
“The announcement of Chiquita Canyon Landfill’s closure is a major victory for the residents of Val Verde, Castaic and surrounding Santa Clarita communities, who have endured unacceptable impacts to their health and quality of life. This moment would not have been possible without the decisive action taken by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board, one of the State’s nine Regional Water Boards, who denied the landfill’s application to expand operations. Today the landfill has found no economic viability to continue trash operations.
While the end of incoming trash means that you will no longer smell the odor of new trash being added to the site, there is still much to be done to address the underground 40 acre fire that will likely be burning for many years. Now, we must focus on this ongoing disaster to ensure the landfill operator upholds its contractual obligations and follows state laws to ensure the long-term stability of the landfill in addition to addressing the public health and environmental disaster that remains. The state and local agencies must continue to work together to implement comprehensive mitigation efforts that hold Waste Connections and Chiquita Canyon Landfill responsible and prioritize the health and safety of our residents.
I remain committed to collaborating with local leaders, Los Angeles County officials, and our state and federal agencies to support affected families, ensure accountability, and develop solutions for the challenges our region continues to face. This includes authoring legislation to exempt compensation from state taxes and state assistance eligibility, as well as securing funding to assist with relocation expenses for those impacted by the landfill.
Thank you to everyone who has raised their voices, to the state agencies, whose leadership and enforcement were critical in addressing the landfill’s persistent violations and ultimately making clear that closure was necessary, and to our community stakeholders who have remained steadfast in holding the landfill accountable. Together, we will continue working toward a healthier, safer future for all.”

SACRAMENTO, CA — Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo was sworn in today to represent Assembly District 40, which includes the Santa Clarita Valley, Castaic, Northwest San Fernando Valley, and north Sylmar. She begins her second term with a commitment to putting money back in people’s pockets, creating an economy that works for all families, addressing housing affordability, and improving community safety.
“I am so grateful to have earned the trust and overwhelming support of our community. Serving as the Assemblywoman for District 40 has been the honor of a lifetime and I am grateful to once again have the opportunity to help make people’s lives better,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “I’m focused on delivering real results that improve the lives of all families, just as we did in our first term.”
In her first term in office, Assemblywoman Schiavo brought back a record amount of nearly 95 million dollars to the district, which will help to create new local jobs, keep our schools and community safe, invest in more housing that’s affordable, and so much more. Those funds include putting more than 1.3 million dollars back in people’s pockets through her office’s work to help families navigate the bureaucracy of state agencies.
Today, the opening day of the new legislative session, Schiavo introduced two bills aimed at providing much needed relief to residents impacted by the ongoing health emergency at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, which is in Assembly District 40.
The first bill would make any compensation received by residents from Chiquita Canyon Landfill exempt from state taxes and excluded from counting against those who qualify for state assistance such as CalFresh, ensuring that affected individuals receive the full benefit of the funds intended to address their hardships and relieving any state financial burdens.
The second bill seeks funding, through the state budget, to assist residents with short or long-term relocation expenses, offering the necessary financial support to those who have no other option than to escape their community due to ongoing and severe health and environmental impacts and illnesses the Val Verde and Castaic communities are experiencing.
“This is about standing up for the health and well-being of our community. Families in Val Verde and Castaic have lived with the harmful impacts of the Chiquita Canyon Landfill for far too long,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “These bills are a step toward justice, relief, and ensuring no one has to choose between their health and their home.”

Pilar Schiavo,"Assemblywoman Schiavo, Rep Mike Garcia, and Legislators Renew Call For State Of Emergency Regarding The Chiquita Canyon Landfill",2024-10-09,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SANTA CLARITA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today announced a renewed bi-partisan call for a state of emergency to support the health and safety of communities impacted by the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. Their letter, which also includes 15 additional legislative signatories, was sent to Governor Gavin Newsom in response to the ongoing underground chemical reaction within the landfill, which has continued to release harmful gasses into the surrounding communities since the reaction escalated in 2023. A community survey conducted by Assemblywoman Schiavo's office highlights the extent of the crisis, with nearly all respondents reporting direct health impacts.
“Residents of Val Verde, Castaic, and students of nearby schools have been subjected to prolonged exposure to harmful emissions, leading to a range of health issues including headaches, nausea, asthma, heart palpitations, and a newly identified cancer cluster. Last week, to get a full understanding of the impacts, I stayed overnight with a family in the area. On their street of 14 houses, seven neighbors have been fighting cancer - one has passed away,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
She continued, “While I am grateful for the robust state, federal and county response to the disaster on the landfill site, neighbors just a few yards away do not have the protections or relief they need to keep themselves and their children safe. We must do more and we need to act now before more people get sick, or worse, die. A state of emergency must be declared and we need to focus relief efforts to get the community out of harm's way and the healthcare and support they need.”
In late 2023, the on-the-ground response at the landfill expanded to include enforcement from local, state, and federal agencies, each providing oversight and issuing violations to the landfill. There has been a coordinated and rapid effort by all parties to remove the toxic liquid, known as leachate, that continues to feed the reaction. The Assemblymember is grateful for how quickly agencies have mobilized and are intensely engaged to end the disaster. However, due to the nature of the reaction, there is no clear end in sight and the temperature of the fire deep in the landfill remains steady at around 200 degrees. Unfortunately, for the surrounding community, this means they continue to be exposed to toxic and cancer-causing chemicals in the air that the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health identified, such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which are known cancer causing chemicals.

“The environmental disaster at Chiquita Canyon has only worsened for residents in Val Verde, Castaic, and the Santa Clarita Valley. Innocent families continue to face severe health problems and financial challenges as a result of this issue. It’s never been clearer: We need a state of emergency declaration,” said Rep. Garcia. “I’m thankful to have a partner in Assemblywoman Schiavo who is willing to take this fight directly to the Governor with me. This joint letter proves that this issue transcends political lines – it’s about protecting the community and urging the state and county to do more for residents,” concluded Rep. Garcia.
With the reaction potentially taking years to end, the community remains in harm's way, with limited financial support to escape.The health and safety of residents is of primary importance, and the community's need for support remains pressing. The state's assistance is crucial for a thorough health study, for relocation services, and for additional actions to mitigate the landfill's impact to residents.
Assemblywoman Schiavo, alongside Congressmember Mike Garcia and 15 state legislators signed the letter urging Governor Newsom to make an emergency declaration to bring relief to the Val Verde and Castaic Community. Many of Schiavo’s legislative colleagues, along with representatives from Senator Padilla, Attorney General Bonta’s and Supervisor Solis’ office, also met with the residents for hours and heard their daily health struggles, which led to the renewed request for a state of emergency declaration to ensure the safety and well-being of our community facing this crisis. The Assemblywoman stands with the community, advocating for prompt and effective solutions to safeguard public health and the environment.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SANTA CLARITA – On September 5th, 2024, at 11:30 AM, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo held a press conference to announce significant legislative wins that protect the financial well-being of Californians. The focus was on AB 2424, the ""Protecting Homeowners During Foreclosure"" bill, and AB 2863, the ""Click to Cancel"" bill. Both bills, designed to safeguard consumers' hard-earned money and ensure greater transparency, have successfully passed through the legislature and are now awaiting the Governor's signature before becoming law.
AB 2424, the ""Protecting Homeowners During Foreclosure"" bill, provides critical safeguards for homeowners facing the threat of foreclosure. This legislation mandates greater transparency in the foreclosure process, ensuring that homeowners have access to clear information and are treated fairly by lenders. By protecting homeowners from predatory practices, AB 2424 helps prevent families from losing their homes and shields them from the financial devastation that can accompany foreclosure.
AB 2863, the ""Click to Cancel"" bill, empowers consumers by making it easier for them to cancel online subscriptions. This bill addresses the growing issue of companies deliberately making the cancellation process difficult, which often results in consumers being charged for services they no longer want or need. By requiring companies to offer straightforward and accessible cancellation options, AB 2863 protects consumers from being unfairly charged and helps them better manage their finances.
“We know too many people in our community are struggling just to get by and need our help. These bills are about protecting the pocketbooks of everyday Californians,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo. “With our ‘Click to Cancel’ bill, we’re leading the nation by being the first state to require straightforward and accessible cancellation options, putting an end to deceptive subscription traps. This first-in-the-nation comprehensive legislation ensures that consumers won’t fall victim to unfair charges. Coupled with our efforts to protect homeowners from predatory foreclosure practices, we’re leading the way to protect our community from unwanted costs and putting money back in the pockets of Californians.”
“Consumers have had enough of the seemingly impossible process of canceling automatic subscriptions,” said CFC Executive Director Robert Herrell. “Consumers should be able to easily click or call to cancel. Additionally, California's foreclosure system far too often strips people in communities of color of their home equity and harms their financial well-being, making them easy prey to predatory loan brokering. Homeowners shouldn't lose their equity due to scams or fraud. CFC's bills in these areas keep consumers from wasting their time and money.”

SANTA CLARITA — As we approach the final week of the legislative session, Assemblywoman Schiavo is proud to highlight one of the non-legislative and most critical functions of her office: delivering for the community through effective casework. Since being elected in 2022, Assemblywoman Schiavo’s office has successfully secured more than $1.1 million for constituents by resolving issues with state agencies and departments.
""Nothing is more important to me than being able to make a real impact for families, especially when so many are struggling to get by,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. ""Casework has made such a profound difference because we've been able to get the wheels turning on behalf of our constituents. When they encounter roadblocks with state agencies, our office steps in to ensure they get the help and the outcomes they deserve and dollars into their pockets.""
This commitment to constituent service is reflected in the stories of residents like Dennis and Joshua, who turned to Assemblywoman Schiavo's office when they hit dead ends with state departments:
“When I bought a car, the dealer made some registration mistakes and collected fees they shouldn’t have since I’m a 100% disabled veteran. I tried to resolve the issue and get a refund from the DMV, accomplishing nothing. The District Office did in a few days what I couldn’t get done in 6 months, and I received my refund and registration,” shared Dennis from Santa Clarita.
Joshua, also from Santa Clarita, also shared his story: “I was having great difficulty straightening out my disability claim with EDD for over 6 weeks. Within 10 days, the district office helped resolve the issue and saved our family from crisis when we received the over $8,000 owed to us.”
From assisting veterans to resolving disability claims or State Franchise Tax board issues, our office has been instrumental in turning bureaucratic hurdles into successful outcomes, ensuring that every dollar owed to constituents is returned.
""Our goal is to ensure that no one in our district feels powerless when dealing with state agencies,"" Schiavo continued. ""By working together, we've proven that we can bring the power of our state agencies directly to our district in a way that makes a tangible difference in the lives of our community members.""

AB 2135: Protecting Workers from Wage Theft

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo Introduces Click to Cancel Bill to Protect Consumers,2024-04-30,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced the introduction of AB 2863 today, a bill aimed at protecting consumers and putting more money back in people’s pockets by simplifying the cancellation process for subscription services. This legislation aligns with similar Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiatives by consumers with a ""Click to Cancel"" option for subscriptions, ensuring the process to unsubscribe is as easy and accessible as signing up.
""The subscription economy makes their money on the backs of consumers, using deceptive practices that cause people to spend more money than they want to. Especially at a time when families are struggling just to get by, things like monthly subscriptions can really add up. This bill will protect people’s pocketbooks from these manipulative subscription models,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “The subscription economy is on track to reach a $1.5 trillion market by 2025, so now is the time to ensure that consumers are protected.”
2022 research showcased that an average of 42% of consumers continue to pay for subscriptions they no longer utilize, costing them approximately $133 more each month. These practices often go unannounced, as companies fail to remind consumers of upcoming renewals, leveraging forgetfulness to boost profits.
“In a world where subscription services too often trap consumers in a maze of renewal processes, AB 2863 puts power back with consumers, where it belongs,” said Robert Herrell, Executive Director of the Consumer Federation of California (CFC) . “CFC is sponsoring AB 2863 because consumers deserve transparent, understandable subscription choices and an easy cancellation process, much like what the FTC is proposing. This bill keeps consumers from unwanted subscriptions and bureaucratic frustration.""
Assemblywoman Schiavo continued, ""AB 2863 will help people keep the approximately $133 they spend each month on subscriptions they don’t use, giving them much needed money for everyday expenses that are already so challenging to afford.”
The bill will begin moving through the California State Assembly later this month.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo’s Legislation to Support Vulnerable Homeowners Advances,2024-04-23,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that AB 2424, a pivotal bill aimed at protecting homeowners facing foreclosure, often at times when they are at their most vulnerable, has successfully passed out of the Assembly Committee on Banking and Finance and the Assembly Committee on Judiciary.
“Often in too many real world situations when people are at their most vulnerable - like after the passing of a partner, when they’re experiencing dementia or other health challenges, or in the middle of a divorce, 120 days of failure to make a mortgage payment is simply not enough time to correct the situation or to make arrangements to either bring the loan current or to otherwise sell the property,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “For some families, a home is their only substantial asset. This legislation will reform foreclosure rules when payments have fallen behind due to unforeseen circumstances, seeking to preserve a portion of the lifetime investments in the property while assuring the banks get repaid,” said Schiavo.
Currently, when a homeowner can’t pay back their mortgage loan, the lender is authorized to sell their home at an auction; first, the lender takes back the loan balance, and the homeowner receives any surplus from the sale. In the process, the homeowner often loses tens, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars when banks sell for extremely low prices. On the other hand, investors frequently benefit from these auctions, making money on the backs of the homeowners who are losing money in the process..
In many instances, these homeowners are low-income, elderly, immigrant, or disabled people. For members of these communities, their home is often their only asset, and home equity is their lifetime savings. The loss of even a single dollaris irreplaceable, putting them at increased risk of poverty and homelessness.
“AB 2424 still ensures the mortgage holder gets repaid, and it also seeks to balance the equities, so that both the bank and the owner of the property get a fair share of their interest in the value of the home,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. 
“The Consumer Federation of California thanks Assemblymember Schiavo for authoring this important bill,"" said CFC Executive Director Robert Herrell. ""Foreclosure is a nightmare even in the best of circumstances, but California's current foreclosure system excessively punishes the most vulnerable Californians. AB 2424 would provide a clear pathway to allow these foreclosed Californians meaningful access to the sometimes substantial equity gains coming from their foreclosed properties and a critical lifeline to benefit from their most meaningful asset in life.""

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Champions Legislation to Combat Retail Theft,2024-04-09,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - In a decisive step toward strengthening the fight against retail theft, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo, alongside Attorney General Rob Bonta, State Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, and a bipartisan coalition of Assemblymembers, this morning introduced a comprehensive legislative package aimed at curtailing the surge in retail crimes. This bill package comes as a result of the months-long effort to tackle this growing crisis, including the formation of the Select Committee on Retail Theft, of which Assemblywoman Schiavo is a member.
At the forefront of this legislative bill package is AB 2943, a bill in which Assemblywoman Schiavo is a principal co-author. This bill specifically targets the organized crime rings behind a growing wave of “smash and grab” retail theft, marking a significant advancement in legislative efforts to protect local businesses and strengthen public safety. AB 2943 creates stringent penalties for ""professional"" retail thieves, introduces measures to combat the online sale of stolen goods, and includes provisions for aggregating theft values to meet grand theft criteria, enhancing the ability of law enforcement to respond effectively to these crimes.
""As a member of the Select Committee on Retail Theft and Principal Co-Author of AB 2843, we have prioritized addressing growing organized retail crime in our community. We have worked to connect with our community about its unique challenges - including launching a survey to gather community data on the impact of retail theft in AD40 - which has led us to today’s announcement of our comprehensive bill package to bring forward real and lasting solutions to retail theft. This legislation will protect our local businesses and economy, ensure the public is safe, and meaningfully collaborate with law enforcement,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “AB 2943, the bill in which I am proud to serve as a principal co-author, will play a crucial role in our broader strategy to combat retail theft, providing law enforcement and businesses with the tools they need to protect Californians. This legislation not only aims to disrupt the operations of crime rings but also ensures that our justice system is equipped to deal with modern challenges in retail theft.”
At this morning’s press conference announcing the legislative bill package, Speaker Rivas remarked, “The goal of the select committee was to act with focus and urgency, and also work to deliver comprehensive, holistic solutions to this problem. I can say that this morning, the Assembly is moving forward a comprehensive, balanced, and bipartisan legislative package that seeks to strengthen public safety, protect shoppers and business owners across California, and ensure that we deliver real, visible, quality of life improvements to Californians.”
The California Chamber of Commerce also joined the press conference in support of the legislative bill package, adding “The listening and collaboration that has gone on has been really key to making sure that this is a comprehensive and effective package that will give law enforcement the tools they need to address this issue in a swift and effective manner.”
Other bills announced as part of the legislative package include AB 1779 (Irwin), AB 1802 (Jones-Sawyer), AB 1960 (Soria), AB1972 (Alanis), and AB3209 (Berman). These bills, in addition to others, are being heard today in the Assembly Public Safety Committee.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Champions Bill to Protect Workers from Wage Theft,2024-03-18,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - In a move to protect workers’ pocketbooks, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo successfully moved AB 2135 past its first hurdle - passing out of the Labor Committee. AB 2135 is aimed at bolstering the rights of employees to seek justice for wage theft by extending the statute of limitations for investigations and ensuring cases aren’t closed simply because the state Labor Commission is unable to complete an investigation. This legislative initiative underscores Assemblywoman Schiavo's commitment to protecting workers’ pocket books by eradicating wage theft, ensuring fair labor practices across the state.
Wage theft is a pervasive issue impacting too many workers, often going unchallenged due to fear of retaliation, insufficient documentation, and the lengthy nature of the complaint process. AB 2135 seeks to dismantle these barriers by providing the Labor Commissioner's office with additional time to assess and resolve complaints, even after the completion of a public works project.
""Introducing AB 2135 is a step towards dismantling the bureaucratic hurdles that have historically been a barrier for workers simply trying to make sure they are paid the fair wages they are owed. When investigations into wage theft are left unresolved, workers are the ones who suffer and unscrupulous employers are allowed to continue taking advantage of vulnerable workers. Our goal is to empower employees and ensure they have the confidence and support to report injustices,"" stated Assemblywoman Schiavo.
“Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 761 strongly supports AB 2135 because it enforces prevailing wage laws. It will help workers get paid the proper wage and holds bad contractors accountable.” stated Greg Lewis, Business Manager for Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 761.
""In 2020 alone, nearly 2,000 cases of wage theft were reported in the context of public works projects, with a significant portion dismissed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations. It's unacceptable for workers to suffer because of systemic inefficiencies. AB 2135 will safeguard their rights by allowing more time for their complaints to be thoroughly investigated,"" added Schiavo.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Calls for State of Emergency in Response to Chiquita Canyon Landfill Crisis,2024-03-12,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO– Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today announced a significant step towards addressing the severe environmental and public health crisis at the Chiquita Canyon Landfill by formally requesting Governor Gavin Newsom declare a state of emergency in Los Angeles County. This request comes in response to ongoing underground chemical reactions within the landfill, which have significantly impacted the surrounding communities since 2023.
Residents of Val Verde, Castaic, and students of nearby schools have been subjected to prolonged exposure to harmful emissions, leading to a range of health issues including headaches, nausea, asthma, and heart palpitations. A community survey conducted by Assemblywoman Schiavo's office highlights the extent of the crisis, with nearly all respondents reporting direct health impacts.
The Los Angeles County Public Health Department's declaration of Chiquita Canyon as a public nuisance, along with elevated findings of benzene and carbon tetrachloride, underscores the urgent need for action. As efforts by the Department of Toxic Substances Control and the Los Angeles Regional Water Control Board continue working to address these issues, the landfill's containment challenges persist, posing an imminent threat to public health and the environment.
The situation has escalated to the point where the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Unilateral Administrative Order, indicating a significant risk to public health and the environment. While a multi-agency critical action team led by the EPA is working to coordinate a response, the community's need for support remains pressing. The state's assistance is crucial for relocation services and additional actions to mitigate the landfill's impact.
Assemblywoman Schiavo's request for a state of emergency declaration is a call to action to ensure the safety and well-being of our community facing this crisis. The Assemblywoman stands with the community, advocating for prompt and effective solutions to safeguard public health and the environment.

The full request to the Governor can be found HERE.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - In an effort to address the critical housing needs of foster youth, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today announced her bill, AB 2674, which encourages private sector investment in affordable housing with units specifically for foster youth and low-income families.
""Access to stable, secure housing is a cornerstone of a healthy, productive life. Yet, foster youth face disproportionately high rates of homelessness and housing insecurity,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. ""Current support programs are valuable, and yet still the lack of available housing for those with vouchers underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. AB 2674 seeks to fill this gap by encouraging private financing for housing projects dedicated to foster youth.""
The introduction of AB 2674 reflects Assemblywoman Schiavo's ongoing commitment to addressing housing security for all Californians, especially the communities most in need. Through this legislation, she continues to advocate for the well-being and future success of the state's most at-risk populations.
""Empowering private investment in affordable housing for foster youth is not just beneficial—it's essential. By ensuring our most vulnerable have a place to call home, we can make a significant impact on the lives of thousands of transitional age foster youth across California,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today the introduction of AB 2499, a bill aimed at extending unpaid sick leave to cover instances when an individual or their family has experienced violent or traumatic events. This groundbreaking legislation seeks to address the gaps in current labor laws, ensuring that survivors and their families have the necessary time to heal without the added stress of potential job loss.
“I am proud to announce the introduction of AB 2499, which will give crime survivors the opportunity to heal and recuperate after a violent or traumatic event. AB 2499 will broaden access to unpaid sick leave to include when an individual or a family member has survived a traumatic event,” stated Assemblywoman Schiavo.
This legislation comes in response to statistics revealing the adverse impacts of crime on workers, with one in six victims of violent crime reporting job loss or demotion due to the need for time off, and 53% of domestic violence survivors losing their jobs due to their circumstances.
Representatives for Legal Aid at Work shared their support for the bill: “No one should have to choose between helping a loved one secure safety from violence and keeping their job. This bill would empower survivors to take specific steps to ensure their safety with their family there to support them when they need it.”

Additionally, Tinisch Hollins, Executive Director of Californians for Safety and Justice, said, “Californians with a family member victimized by domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking or other forms of violence should be allowed to take a few days off of work to provide support to their loved ones without having to worry about losing their job. Our collective safety requires us to ensure all families have the ability to heal and feel safe. We risk exacerbating cycles of crime and harm if we fail to provide adequate pathways for healing in our communities, and we are proud to stand with Asm. Schiavo in our shared fight to achieve safety and justice for everyone in California.”
AB 2499 represents a critical step forward in Assemblywoman Schiavo's ongoing commitment to supporting crime survivors and strengthening worker protections. By providing a pathway for healing and safety, this legislation aims to contribute to breaking cycles of crime and fostering a community where every member can thrive.

SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today the introduction of AB 2294, a bill that incentivizes the hiring of new employees by expanding businesses eligible for tax credits with an incentive to hire people from under-resourced communities, supporting businesses and encouraging investment in good jobs for people who need them most.
“AB 2294 is a win-win, giving businesses the ability to hire new employees from communities that are looking for good paying jobs,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “I’m excited to introduce legislation that supports businesses, creates good high paying jobs, and supports those looking for employment.”
The New Employment Credit (NEC) was established in 2013 to incentivize the hiring of individuals who have historically faced barriers to employment, including veterans. This bill would expand the businesses eligible to hire new employees in the form of tax credits, eliminating certain location requirements, expanding to more qualified employees, and reaching a much broader range of businesses.
The Legislative Analyst’s Office states that the low amounts of claimed credits through this program suggest that the existing tax credit limitations have been challenging for businesses to use, citing the credits’ high wage threshold, small credit amount, complexity, uncertainty, and interaction with other credits as contributing to low participation.
“AB 2294 seeks to break down barriers and limitations, fully realizing the NEC’s potential by creating more job opportunities for those who have difficulty landing jobs and who may be at risk of homelessness,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
In addition to the legislative progress made to fight for worker protections and bring good jobs to Assembly District 40, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s office will be hosting a community Job & Resource Fair In partnership with America’s Job Center of California. Local employers like LADWP, Northeast Valley Health Corporation, California Children's Academy, and more will be in attendance and are looking to fill open positions. We encourage everyone to join us in exploring promising career opportunities. Those interested can RSVP HERE.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Introduces Bill to Bring Transparency and Accountability to California’s Transportation Investments,2024-02-09,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced the introduction of the Transportation Accountability Act, AB 2086, which will create needed transparency and accountability in California’s transportation investments, paving the way for a more efficient and equitable transportation system. The Greenlining Institute and TransForm are co-sponsors of this vital legislation.
California is experiencing climate disasters with more and more regularity. The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in our state. Yet, legislation designed to address these emissions has been undermined by a lack of transparency about where California’s transportation budget goes and whether those investments are serving our climate goals.
The Transportation Accountability Act requires the state to set targets, track, and regularly report to the legislature and the public how transportation dollars support state and federal mandates.
“Our state’s transportation system impacts the daily lives of every Californian, as well as the state’s ambitious climate, equity, economic, and safety goals. Yet the legislature and public have no meaningful way of tracking the impacts of California’s transportation investments and how they are supporting or hampering progress toward our goals. The Transportation Accountability Act will lay the foundation for transforming the way California invests in transportation to ensure future transportation initiatives improve mobility and help us meet state and federal goals while advancing equity for all,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. 
State and federal agencies‘ that impact California’s transportation system include:
“California has historically failed to align its transportation investments with state and federal goals; we need our transportation agencies to be transparent and show that they are meeting these goals,” Schiavo continued.
“Decades of inequitable transportation policies and investments have burdened communities of color and low-income communities with worse health and economic outcomes. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Transportation investments have the potential to yield more economic opportunities by creating high-quality jobs, increasing options to get people to work, and improving local economic activity. Our communities deserve transparency and accountability to ensure we don’t replicate harms, and the state needs this information to target resources and maximize taxpayer dollars,” said Alvaro Sanchez, Vice President of Policy at The Greenlining Institute. “The Transportation Accountability Act is essential to those goals.”
“Despite spending billions of dollars annually on transportation, California is failing to meet our own climate and safety goals. The Transportation Accountability Act is an essential step to ensure everyone can safely and conveniently access what they need and enjoy fulfilling lives without the fear of climate catastrophe,” said Zack Deutsch-Gross, Policy Director at TransForm.
“The Transportation Accountability Act helps ensure benefits promised to the Californians, state, local, and regional governments and the public are transparent and can be fulfilled. By understanding the impacts and gaps, the state can make more effective, responsible, and fair transportation investments for decades to come,” said Schiavo.

SANTA CLARITA - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today announced the allocation of $593,000 in funding to the Child & Family Center for crucial infrastructure and safety enhancements. This investment comes as a vital step to ensure the continued delivery of quality care and services for our communities in need of mental health, substance use treatment, and domestic violence prevention services.
Members of the media, community leaders, and the public are invited to attend this check presentation event and learn more about the impact this investment will have on the future of the Child & Family Center.
Event Details:
The Child & Family Center has long been a cornerstone of support for Medi-Cal recipient communities, offering essential care and assistance to individuals facing various challenges. Recognizing the importance of sustaining and enhancing these services, Assemblywoman Schiavo championed the allocation of funds to address critical needs within the Center.
The awarded funds will facilitate several key improvements, including:
Nikki Buckstead, CEO of the Child & Family Center stated, “Child & Family Center is thrilled to be the recipient of this infrastructure funding through Assemblywoman Schiavo’s office. Quite simply, our government contracts don’t cover the costs of the ongoing necessary upgrades and safety measures our Center needs. This funding will also allow us to purchase a much-needed minivan for our Domestic Violence Program, which will allow the safe passage of the women and children who are escaping violent and dangerous situations and transport them to our confidential emergency shelter.”
“I am committed to ensuring that vital community organizations like the Child & Family Center have the resources necessary to keep our community safe from domestic violence.

Pilar Schiavo,Military and Veterans Affairs Committee Chair Pilar Schiavo Introduces Bill Package To Protect and Support Veterans,2024-02-01,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Military and Veterans Affairs Committee Chair Pilar Schiavo announced today a package of three bills dedicated to improving financial protections for reservists and ensuring the Department of Veterans Affairs is serving all veterans, delivering on her commitment to protecting and supporting our veterans.
“The state has established a number of programs to support reservists and veterans; however, as Legislators, it’s our job to make sure these programs are working as intended and that departments are held accountable when they’re not,” said Schiavo. “With this package of bills, we can improve the financial protections for those serving, gain clarity on what aspects of the Department of Veterans affairs can be improved, and ensure a voice continues to advocate in the Department for those who have historically had difficulty accessing the benefits they deserve for their service to the United States.”
A summary of the legislation includes:
AB 1854 will help ensure that when members of the Guard and Reserve are called to active duty, they are able to use credit protections granted to them under existing law. Members of the Guard and Reserve are often called to active duty on very short notice, and sometimes don’t learn of the protections the law provides until it is too late to take advantage of them. The bill creates a 180-day window following their activation during which they may apply for retroactive deferment of payment and interest on specified debts, such as credit cards, vehicle loans, and mortgages.

AB 1908 will improve government transparency and performance by requiring the California Department of Veterans Affairs to report to the Legislature on the findings of its internal auditor. The requirement imposed by the bill is similar to one that already applies to the California Military Department’s Inspector General.
AB 1994 will strengthen representation in state government of minority and underrepresented veterans. The bill adds the Deputy Secretary of Minority and Underrepresented Veterans Affairs to those deputies whose appointments are specified in statute. Those already enshrined in statute are the Undersecretary, the Deputy Secretary of Women Veterans Affairs and the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Homes. The position is a relatively new one, but it is an important one. Minority veterans are less likely to receive benefits, and often live in areas where there are service gaps. Native American veterans, in particular, whose representation in the Armed Forces is about double their proportion of the general population, are less likely to receive benefits that they were entitled to, or could have established eligibility for.
Currently, all three bills are in the Assembly Committee on Rules awaiting referral to the relevant policy committee.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo Takes Action to Streamline Affordable Housing Development,2024-01-11,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Schiavo kicked off the legislative year by introducing AB 1820, a bill designed to demystify housing developer fees and provide information needed to ensure affordable housing is delivered as quickly as possible without surprise costs. Introducing this as her first bill demonstrates Schiavo’s commitment to removing barriers and getting affordable housing online as quickly as possible, one of her “3 H’s” of policy focus - housing, homelessness and healthcare. 
“Affordable housing developers already operate on razor thin margins, and knowing what fees they’ll need to pay ahead of time provides a level of certainty and will reduce the number of projects that fall short of funding,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “I’m grateful that Speaker Rivas highlighted the need to address fees for housing development at the start of this legislative year, and I’m excited to introduce AB 1820 to help address one of the roadblocks to creating more housing people can afford.”
Affordable housing developers often face a lack of transparency when local agencies don’t provide the costs for local permitting fees up front. Currently, developers submit an initial permit to their local jurisdiction for approval, but fees that cities and counties impose are disclosed only after each phase of the project moves forward. In some cases, these fees can account for up to eighteen percent of the cost of the project, making affordable housing construction that much more costly and sometimes leading to delays, or stalling of projects, while additional funding has to be secured. Current law requires cities and counties to clearly post fees online. To date, many local jurisdictions have not complied with the mandate, make fees difficult to find on their web-sites, or provide incomplete and unreliable information.
AB 1820 would allow developers to request a fee and exaction statement estimate from their local jurisdiction. This request would allow developers to have a better financial picture of the cost of a development before committing to building the project, which would ensure affordable housing developments are brought online quickly and to completion.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo responded to the first draft of the Governor’s 2024-25 State General Fund Budget in a statement released today:
“Today, the Governor released his first draft of the 2024-25 State General Fund Budget.
While the Department of Finance estimates a much smaller budget shortfall than was originally projected, we still face a $37.5 billion deficit. Fortunately, our state reserves and “rainy day” fund will provide resources to lessen the impacts of otherwise inevitable cuts. As legislators, we have our work cut out for us to protect our communities and ensure we still deliver the services that so many families rely on, at a time when so many are struggling to afford housing, healthcare, and pay monthly bills.
I was pleased to see that despite the deficit, no cuts are proposed to behavioral health services, which means the most vulnerable Californians will continue to receive uninterrupted care. The Governor also preserved billions of dollars in recent investments to expand the state’s capacity to provide healthcare for those who need it most.
Our 3 Hs - housing, healthcare, and homelessness - will continue to be my top priority as we put forth legislative solutions while navigating this budget deficit. As budget discussions continue leading up to May, when the Governor will offer his revised budget, I will fight to ensure those who are struggling to get by get the support and services they need.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s Bills to Streamline Affordable Housing Signed by Governor,2023-10-13,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo today announced that Governor Newsom signed her package of bills (AB 519 and AB 911) to streamline the development of affordable housing. These bills reduce administrative barriers and allow restrictive covenants to be modified during the purchase of the property, which will make a major impact on getting affordable housing developed across the state and help us address our housing affordability crisis.
“Communities across California, including those in our district, are facing a housing crisis. Too many families simply can’t afford housing they can afford, and that is partly due to the roadblocks faced by developers who build affordable housing. That’s why when I came to Sacramento, one of my priorities was focused on ensuring we address this growing crisis - I am proud that these two bills go a long way to reducing red tape and ensuring we can get more affordable housing built as quickly as possible,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
Schiavo continued, “AB 519 removes red tape by reducing administrative barriers and costs in housing development, and AB 911 will provide more opportunities and choice where families want to live. I am grateful that the Governor signed both of these bills and I look forward to working with him to expedite the process.” 
AB 519: Streamlining Affordable & Permanent Homeless Housing Development
California’s affordable housing and permanent homeless housing finance system is currently comprised of four separate entities which administer a variety of financial resources including tax credits, tax-exempt bonds, soft loans, and grants to housing developers who build and rehabilitate affordable housing for lower-income households and for people experiencing homelessness. Having so many funding sources increases costs - a Terner Center report found that each additional source of funding a developer applies for increases development costs by approximately 2%. Affordable housing projects already operate on razor thin margins, and additional administrative costs create barriers that decrease the number of units which ultimately get built.
AB 519 requires the California Department of Housing and Community Development, The California Housing Finance Agency, and the Treasurer’s Office to jointly convene a workgroup composed of affordable and permanent supportive housing developers, local governments, and tribal governments to help create a single consolidated application and coordinated review process amongst the state entities involved in affordable housing finance. The workgroup is required to report recommendations to the Legislature on implementing a single application, and each of the state entities must provide a plan on updating their programs based upon the workgroup's findings.
AB 911: Removing Restrictive Covenants
For decades, restrictive covenants on land use have prevented people of color or members of a certain religion from accessing housing in specific areas. These covenants shaped the landscape of neighborhoods and cities by creating segregated boundaries. Many of these types of covenants are prohibited and no longer enforceable, however some covenants, like density restrictions, still exist today.
For an affordable housing developer, a density restrictive covenant on a piece of real estate creates another financial barrier to a developer who wants to bring affordable homes to a community quickly. AB 721 (Bloom, 2021) established a process for removing density covenants for 100% affordable housing; however, this could only be done after the purchase, creating hesitancy in some developers. The passage of AB 911 allows a developer to check to make sure a covenant can be removed for their project and to remove the restrictive covenant while the property is in escrow thus streamlining the process and moving the project forward to shovel ready.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo’s Bill Modernizing Healthcare Access In California Signed by Governor,2023-10-11,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that her bill, Modernizing Healthcare Access in California (AB 1697), was signed into law by Governor Newsom. The legislation reduces administrative barriers to healthcare access that patients face in authorizing medical providers or sharing their medical history by giving equal legal weight to electronic signatures. 
""Patients deserve timely healthcare and having to sign a paper form should never be a barrier that delays care. Our bill, which was just signed by the Governor, acknowledges the progress we have made in online transactions and digital security, and ensures patients receive prompt care without compromising their security or delaying access to healthcare. This bill brings California into current day technology saving Californians time, money and frustration so they can focus on getting the care they need."" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. 
Over the course of the pandemic, telehealth created an invaluable link for many to timely access to health care. The Government Accountability Office found that telehealth use among Medicaid beneficiaries increased fifteen fold in 2021. However, as these appointments increasingly occur online, the need for a physical signature on necessary medical release forms has created a new and unnecessary barrier to accessing healthcare. Requiring signatures at a facility during business hours from individuals with inflexible schedules, or requiring a signature via mail, can delay needed care unnecessarily. AB1697 removes those barriers so everyone has access to the healthcare they need and deserve.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and Senator Scott Wilk Deliver Major Victory for Santa Clarita on CEMEX Mine Project,2023-10-03,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SANTA CLARITA - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that her bill, Community Water Protection (AB163), in which Senator Scott Wilk was a Principal Co-Author, helped advance a critical priority for the Santa Clarita Valley: allowing for public comment on the more than 30 year old CEMEX mine project. The pressure of the bill compelled the State Water Board to take the action outlined in the bill, which will now give the public a chance to share their position on the community impact of the CEMEX mine, something the community of Santa Clarita has been demanding for years.
“A lot has changed in 30 years, and this legislation is about transparency, public engagement, and ensuring that our community has a voice in such an important resource — water,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
AB 1631 would have required the State Water Board to reissue notices of applications for all water appropriations if they are pending approval for more than 30 years, allowing protest and public comment on decades-old projects. While Governor Newsom announced he would not sign AB 1631 into law, he re-affirmed that the State Water Board would reissue a notice of application for water appropriation, reopening public comment on this controversial project.
Assemblywoman Schiavo continued, “I know the Governor shares our community’s concerns about the ability to have our voices heard on a decades-old project. His message acknowledging that what this bill sought to do is in motion. I am grateful the persistence of our community and bipartisan effort with my colleague, Senator Wilk, will deliver for the people of Santa Clarita.” 
Senator Scott Wilk said in a statement, “It was fantastic to see the Governor reaffirm that the State Water Board will re-notice CEMEX’s application by the end of the year. Finally after 30 years, this is a major victory for the Santa Clarita Valley. The proposed mega-mine is a threat to our water supply, and would wreak havoc on our roads and air quality. The Governor's message ensures residents will get the opportunity they deserve to publicly voice their concerns against this disastrous project. It has been a pleasure to work alongside Assemblywoman Schiavo this year to get this done for our shared community.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Stands with California Attorney General Rob Bonta in Legal Action Against Dangerous Practice by Anti-Abortion Groups,2023-09-21,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo issued a statement today in full support of California Attorney General Rob Bonta's announcement of a lawsuit against Heartbeat International (HBI) and RealOptions Obria, two organizations accused of falsely advertising abortion pill reversal (APR) as safe and effective. The legal action seeks to protect the rights of Californians to access accurate and comprehensive reproductive health information.
“I am encouraged that Attorney General Bonta is taking on these dangerous practices for a procedure that threatens the health of women - abortion pill reversal. Recommended to women who have recently taken the abortion pill, this abortion reversal is not supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists because it is dangerous and, ‘not based on science and do[es] not meet clinical standards’. When a Crisis Pregnancy Center discussed abortion pill reversal in a hearing on my abortion protection bill (AB 710), the doctor testifying on my bill told me about a woman who came to the ER bleeding out and needing urgent care from this procedure. It’s disturbing that the anti-abortion ideology of these groups outweighs science and the health and safety of women, which is why I am so grateful for the life-saving action of AG Bonta,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “I am hopeful that in the next legislative session, we will take on this entire industry, whose main goal is undermining a woman’s right to choose and blocking access to abortion care.”
In her statement, Assemblywoman Schiavo also emphasized the critical importance of protecting abortion rights amidst a national landscape where access to abortion care is increasingly under threat.
""Abortion rights are being attacked across the country. With millions of women no longer able to access the abortion care they need. In California, Crisis Pregnancy Centers that offer or refer out for abortion pill reversal is the new frontier of the anti- abortion movement. But California must take on these organizations when it threatens Women’s health and access to safe abortion care. As a state, we are well positioned to expand and protect these rights for all Californians and be a safe haven for women across the country,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
One of Assemblywoman Schiavo's legislative priorities for the current session was to protect and expand the right to choose. A vital aspect of this effort involves ensuring that individuals have access to factual information about where they can obtain abortion care. Unfortunately, deceptive practices employed by some crisis pregnancy centers have posed a significant challenge to this goal.
""So many crisis pregnancy centers, which now outnumber abortion clinics in California by 20%, use deceptive practices to lure vulnerable women into their centers for care when in fact, most don't provide any reproductive health services, compromising women's ability to get abortion care when time is of the essence and when they most need support. In fact, 75% of crisis pregnancy centers in California don't have a licensed medical professional on site,"" Assemblywoman Schiavo added.
The lawsuit brought forward by Attorney General Rob Bonta aims to address these deceptive practices and protect Californians from being misled by organizations that claim to offer abortion pill reversal services without adequate medical expertise or scientific basis.

SACRAMENTO - “Late last Thursday evening the Assembly wrapped up legislative business for the first of its two year session. Nearly 1100 bills were sent to the Governor this year. He has until October 14 to sign or veto.
This year proved to be successful in maintaining a balanced budget, despite a greater than $34 billion shortfall. In addition we passed SB 14 (Grove) which makes human trafficking a “strike felony,” a bill I was happy to support. In addition we passed a $6.4 billion Behavioral Health Bond, which includes $1 billion set aside for veterans to finance permanent behavioral health treatment and housing for individuals experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness with severe behavioral health challenges.
I was also proud to co-author several pieces of legislation including:
Women’s Health
AB 230 (Reyes) Which expands the requirement that schools serving students in grades 6 through 12 stock specified restrooms with menstrual products to include schools serving students in grades 3 to 5.
SB 345 (Skinner) Which enacts various safeguards against the enforcement of other states’ laws that prohibit, or criminalize a person, provider, or other entity in California that offers reproductive health care services. 
Supporting Kids & Families
AB 393 (Luz Rivas) Which requires the Director of the California Department of Social Services to develop procedures for general or migrant childcare and development contractors to identify and report data on dual language learners.
AB 1015 (Calderon) Which would create a statewide diaper and wipe distribution program for low-income families.
Fentanyl & Public Safety
AB 889 (Joe Patterson) Which would require a local educational agency, county office of education, and charter schools to annually inform parents, or guardians of the dangers associated with using synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl, and post this information on their respective internet websites.
AB 1060 (Ortega) Which would require coverage of prescription, or nonprescription naloxone hydrochloride and all other FDA approved medication for the complete or partial reversal of an opioid overdose.
SB 55 (Umberg) Which would prohibit motor vehicle dealers from selling a vehicle equipped with a catalytic converter unless the converter has been permanently marked with the vehicle’s identification number.
Business & Workers
AB 1217 (Gabriel) Which preserves important flexibility so that restaurants can maintain outdoor dining in an efficient and affordable manner. 
SB 822 (Durazo) Which would create the California Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to assist state agencies in advancing high quality jobs with investments in the broadband, energy, resources, technology, and transportation sectors.
Water & the Environment
AB 30 (Ward) Which would require the Department of Water Resources to utilize all information generated by the Atmospheric Rivers Program to better manage reservoirs to improve flood protection and capture water generated by atmospheric rivers and other storms.
SB 659 (Ashby) Which would require the Department of Water Resources to provide recommendations to develop additional groundwater recharge opportunities that increase the recharge of the state’s groundwater basins.
Protecting Democracy
AB 421 (Bryan) Reduces confusion by requiring, for a state referendum, that voters be asked to choose between the options ""Keep the law"" or ""Overturn the law"" rather than being asked to vote ""Yes"" or ""No."" Also requires the top campaign funders of an effort to qualify a state referendum to be listed in the state voter information guide.
SB 52 (Durazo) Requires the City of Los Angeles to establish an independent redistricting commission to adjust the district boundaries for the city council.
I am proud of the work we were able to accomplish this year and was especially pleased to work with my colleagues across the aisle and happy to co-author and otherwise support common sense measures that benefit all Californians.”

SACRAMENTO – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that at the close of the Legislative session, seven key pieces of her authored legislation are now on the Governor’s desk. The legislation put forth by the Assemblywoman prioritizes issues most important to the community, including housing affordability, real solutions to homelessness, healthcare access, community safety and environmental protections. The Governor has until October 14th to make a decision on whether to sign or veto bills.
“I came to Sacramento to start delivering on day one and to make progress on the issues that matter most to our community. The bills now awaiting the Governor’s signature will do just that,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “I am so proud of the bipartisan support and common sense solutions we brought forth in this legislation on issues ranging from housing to homelessness to healthcare, I look forward to the Governor signing these policies into law.”
The legislation currently on the Governor’s desk includes:

Housing and Homelessness
Healthcare
Community Safety and Environmental Protections
Supporting and Coauthored Legislation
Assemblywoman Schiavo was also the co-author and key supporter of many critical pieces of legislation now awaiting the Governor’s signature, including:
Two Year Bills Still Pending:
In addition to the bills moving the Governor, Assemblymember Schiavo has already fully passed a bill protecting seniors and the disabled community from abuse and crimes (AB 751) and from attacks on Medicare (AJR 4).

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo Makes Progress Protecting Medicare for Seniors with Passage of AJR 4,2023-09-08,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today the passage of Assembly Joint Resolution 4 (AJR 4) off the Senate Floor. AJR 4, The Medicare Protection Act of 2023, calls on the Legislature to request President Biden, a champion of Medicare, terminate the Accountable Care Organization REACH (ACO REACH) pilot program. This program directly undermines the direct principles of traditional Medicare by incentivizing profits and limiting delivery of health care.
With more than sixty co-authors, AJR4 has received bipartisan support in both houses.
“Unaware seniors who depend on traditional Medicare for their healthcare needs may be re-assigned into these ACO REACH programs, directly threatening their free choice of primary care providers,” said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo.
“These programs also have a well-documented history of overcharging in the billions of national taxpayer dollars by Wall Street investors and corporate profiteers threatening the financial security of Medicare and healthcare our seniors rely on. ACO REACH is the re-branding of the Medicare Advantage Program. California houses 20 percent of the nationally approved ACO REACH programs, posing a significant risk to seniors and vulnerable populations who rely on Medicare in our state.
AJR 4 was supported by the California Alliance for Retired Americans (CARA) and sends a strong message that California, home of the nation’s largest Medicare Population (6.3 Million and growing), will no longer tolerate a national program that could have detrimental effects to our health care system, further destabilize Medicare’s funding, and threaten the health and wellbeing of our seniors and people with disabilities. California is the first to pass a resolution requesting the termination of the ACO REACH pilot program, following 2-years of protests and campaigning from grassroots activists and Congressional leaders across the nation.
""Today the California Legislature stands in support of seniors in California and nationwide to stop the ACO REACH program that is financially draining the Medicare Trust Fund by lining the pockets of the private insurance industry and Wall Street investors,” said Cindy Young, Vice President of CARA. “We can and must protect the traditional Medicare program so that seniors can continue to see physicians of their choice in their community instead of being forced into narrow networks with limited access to local providers. CARA thanks the California's Legislature, and in particular, Assemblywoman Schiavo for calling on the Biden Administration to cease the ACO-REACH.""

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo’s Community Water Protection Bill Passes Senate Floor; Moves To Governor's Desk,2023-09-07,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO — In a groundbreaking development for California's water management, Assemblywoman Schiavo today announced that the State Senate has approved her Community Water Protection Bill (AB 1631) - moving it to the final step where the bill awaits the Governor’s signature. This legislation promises to reshape the state's approach to managing water resources by providing the public with the opportunity to address their concerns related to water projects’ impact on their community. This initiative targets projects with water appropriation applications that have been pending with the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) for over three decades, including the CEMEX project near Santa Clarita.
This bill received bi-partisan support, and was able to make it through the legislature in partnership with State Senator Scott Wilk. Senator Wilk said in a statement, “This is a major victory for the Santa Clarita Valley, and the result of a long battle I have fought since I first arrived in Sacramento. The CEMEX mega-mine didn’t belong in our valley 30 years ago, and it certainly doesn’t belong there today. This bill ensures residents will get the opportunity they deserve to voice their rightful concerns before the State Water Resources Control Board. It has been a pleasure to work across the aisle with Assemblywoman Schiavo in getting this done for our community, and I look forward to crossing the finish line together.”
CEMEX would be the largest aggregate, or gravel, mine in North America. During the three decades since the application that the CEMEX mine has remained with the SWRCB, significant concerns about water resources have arisen. Similar issues may surface for other projects with long-pending water appropriation applications across the state. Because the mine would be located along the Santa Clara river, one of the last natural rivers in southern California that provides needed water to the Santa Clarita Valley and beyond. With shifting dynamics in water availability due to climate change, AB 1631 enables community members to provide up-to-date concerns to the board, ensuring that these projects align with the current public interest and environmental priorities.
“Our legislation, with its focus on transparency and public engagement, represents a pivotal moment in California's water management,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo “It aims to ensure that our community has a voice in such an important resource - water. It’s critical our water resources are protected and preserved in the best interests of our residents. Now that this bill has passed the Assembly and the Senate, I look forward to seeing the Governor sign AB 1631”.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and State Senator Henry Stern Denounce CPUC Decision To Increase Gas Storage at Aliso Canyon Facility,2023-08-31,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
 
PORTER RANCH, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and State Senator Henry Stern - who both represent Porter Ranch in the legislature - today denounced the decision by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to increase gas storage capacity at the Aliso Canyon facility. The site of the worst gas leak in U.S. history, Governor Newsom previously committed to working towards closing the Aliso Canyon facility, a reaction to the health and safety impacts already endured by the community and the potential for continued safety concerns.
While energy security is important, this shortsighted decision by the CPUC to grant SoCal Gas their request comes without enough information on the premise of that request - they have not shown that increasing the storage at the facility would change the cost of gas for consumers or eliminate price spikes. More importantly, this decision could come at the expense of public safety, environmental integrity, and community health, raising significant concerns about the potential risks and impacts associated with such an expansion.
""As a member of the Utility and Energy Committee, I am committed to lowering gas prices, determining why we saw a price spike earlier this year, and ensuring we meet demand. Given the information I was provided at a recent hearing on this very issue, I am not convinced that increasing storage at Aliso Canyon will accomplish any of these goals. I do, however, know that increasing storage may compromise the safety of our community, as it did in 2015 when we had the biggest gas leak in our country’s history,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. ""We cannot afford to ignore the lessons learned from the previous leak, which forced more than 25,000 residents and two schools to evacuate and countless neighbors who still face ongoing health challenges related to their exposure.”
Schiavo continued, “Importantly, we know that when SoCal Gas had adequate storage available last winter, they instead bought gas from other sources at astronomical gas prices and passed those painful costs onto consumers, causing the price spikes we all contended with. When SoCal Gas didn’t use the gas they already had in storage to reduce gas price increases, it makes you wonder why they would now claim they need this storage increase for that same purpose – this doesn’t instill trust that SoCal Gas will protect us from high prices in the future or manage their storage appropriately.""
The Aliso Canyon facility has experienced a history of incidents that have had serious consequences for the surrounding communities. Thus, any decision regarding its operations should be based on a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the potential risks, as well as a transparent engagement with the concerns of local residents, and most certainly should not be done simply because the entity who has the most to gain financially by the outcome requested it.
Senator Henry Stern added, “The CPUC’s decision to double down on Aliso without completing its investigation into SoCalGas’ price spikes last winter, without any firm commitment to closure, has left ratepayers and residents in a dangerous kind of limbo. It feels like we’ve just handed the reins to the Gas Company and I don’t believe they’ve earned that trust.”
Last winter, SoCal Gas purchased high cost natural gas rather than tapping into the reserves stored at Aliso Canyon, which does not align with the CPUC’s position that increasing natural gas storage will decrease prices for residents. In fact, there are ongoing CPUC and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigations into last winter’s price spike, information that would be critical in establishing if increased storage would in fact have prevented price increases last winter. Instead, the CPUC is simply taking SoCal Gas’ word for it, even though their word is in direct opposition to their actions last winter.
Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo and Senator Henry Stern remain steadfast in their commitment to holding the CPUC accountable for their responsibility to protect our community, SoCal Gas accountable for the gas spikes last winter, and in seeking ways to mitigate potential risks while exploring alternative solutions to meet the energy needs of the state.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Joins Area Legislators to Speak Out Against Aliso Canyon Proposal,2023-08-03,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced her opposition to the new Aliso Canyon proposal, joining with area legislators who shared their concerns about increasing storage at the facility before the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and federal authorities have completed their investigations into the causes of the winter gas price spikes.
Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo (AD40), Senator Henry Stern (SD27), and Congressman Brad Sherman (CD32) collectively represent the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, where the largest methane leak in U.S. history forced thousands to flee their homes, many experiencing health impacts of the leak. They came out in solidarity with impacted communities against the proposal:
“This proposal is an unwelcome surprise. SoCalGas says more use of this dangerous gas field will keep prices down, but there are still too many unanswered questions to proceed. What responsibility does the Gas Company and their parent company Sempra owe Southern California ratepayers? If more storage can bring down prices, why didn’t SoCalGas Company use their available storage during last year’s spike instead of buying gas at unprecedented high rates? Federal and state investigations are asking these, and other, questions in order to understand the cause of price spikes, however, this proposed decision appears premature.
The impacted communities deserve reassurance that this proposal will not undercut the Governor’s commitment to closure and that the proposed increase is, in fact, necessary. Such assurance can be made, alongside this decision, if the CPUC finalized their long delayed, but well proposed, decision to responsibly phase out Aliso. This proposal goes in the opposite direction.”
Background on the Proposal
The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is proposing to increase the maximum capacity at Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Facility, against both the community’s wishes and Governor Gavin Newsom’s plan to shut down the facility. The maximum capacity of the facility was reduced following the 2015 leak as a safety precaution, and many outstanding questions still remain. The current proposal is based on insufficient evidence that Aliso capacity is connected to the price of natural gas, an assertion that comes straight from SoCalGas without any support and before completing a very important federal and state investigation. In fact, earlier this year, when natural gas prices were spiking, instead of using the natural gas already stored at Aliso and other area facilities, SoCalGas purchased more expensive natural gas. If using what’s in storage was a solution to the increase in natural gas prices, SoCalGas could have already done that this year. Using a vulnerable moment for families in our community as a way to lobby for increased storage at Aliso is disingenuous at best.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
CHATSWORTH – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that she secured needed funding for an interim housing site in Chatsworth, one key way to help solve our homelessness crisis. Assemblywoman Schiavo secured $200,000 for the Devonshire Lodge Project Homekey Site. This funding was presented at the site last week, and is intended for needed fire and life safety improvements to move the site from interim to permanent housing.
""I’m happy to join Mayor Karen Bass to combine our efforts to bring real solutions to the homelessness crisis. By combining the efforts of the state and city, we have and will continue to secure the crucial funding necessary to make a tangible impact on the lives of those experiencing homelessness in our communities,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “With a shared commitment to this cause, we are dedicated to implementing innovative programs and fostering partnerships that include prioritizing the development of more permanent housing with supportive services, so people don’t fall back into homelessness once they are housed.”
Working to deliver real solutions to homelessness is work Assemblywoman Schiavo started prior to serving in the Assembly. Previously, Schiavo co-founded an organization that has delivered more than 50,000 meals to people in need, helped secure housing for veterans and seniors experiencing homelessness, and has increased resources to keep our communities safe.
Schiavo continued, “This is especially meaningful to me, having done this work for years before entering into the legislature. I am grateful to have been able to secure state funding so we can be in partnership to ensure my own community of Chatsworth is able to be part of the housing solution we need to transform lives and stabilize our communities.”
More on the Project Roomkey Site: The Devonshire Lodge is a former motel acquired through the State’s Homekey program for use as interim housing and conversion to permanent supportive housing. The site is located in Chatsworth and has 75 units. Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo secured $200,000 for the City to fund safety improvements at the motel.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo Championed Budget Item to Reduce Healthcare Costs Included in State Budget,2023-07-25,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.

Sacramento, CA – Earlier this month, the budget approved by Governor Newsom and accompanying trailer bill language directs $82.5 million toward directly reducing health care deductibles and co-pays for Covered California participants. Championed by Assemblymember Schiavo (D-Chatsworth), the funds make use of fines collected through the individual mandate penalty that were always intended to go toward reducing healthcare costs for low-income Californians.
When the individual mandate passed in 2019, the intent of the mandate was to protect the health and welfare of residents and ensure access to affordable health coverage. Unfortunately, in a survey conducted by the California Health Care Foundation in 2021, nearly half of respondents cited cost as a reason for skipping care in the prior year, with many of those who skipped care having their conditions worsen. Further, a quarter experienced or knew a family member who had difficulty paying a medical bill. That percentage jumps to forty-three percent for low-income Californians. The Assemblymember commented:
“There are thousands of Californians who have health insurance but don’t have the financial security to be able to use it. I was proud to champion this budget request, and I’m grateful to the Governor for ensuring that these funds will help low-income Californians seek preventative and timely care without fear of unaffordable deductibles or a budget breaking bill.”
According to Health Access California, the organization that has advocated for this change for years, $82.5 million would benefit an estimated 650,000 current Covered California enrollees. In addition to the funding for this year, the accompanying trailer bill allocates $165 million for 2025 and beyond to directly reduce out-of-pocket costs for low-income Californians.
“As Californians battle with rising cost-of-living, this major state budget investment ensures that hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescription drugs will remain affordable for hundreds of thousands of Californians,” said Diana Douglas, Policy and Legislative Director for Health Access California. “This is a great example of how policymakers, patient advocates, legislators and the Governor can come together to provide real relief for affordability and keep a promise to keep health care dollars in health care.”
With the federal Inflation Reduction Act capping rate increases at 8.5% of income and the new state cost-sharing reductions, Covered California plans will remain competitive and affordable. For more information on 2024 rates and plans please visit www.CoveredCA.com.

Sacramento, CA – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo released the following statement today regarding the recent budget bills signed by Governor Newsom:
“I’m happy to report that the Governor just signed the remaining budget bills, including AB 102, which amends the main budget bill and includes more than $20 million of investments we fought to bring back to our assembly district. I’m pleased to see that due to sound fiscal management, the Assembly has positioned our state well to deal with declining revenues. This enables us to protect the progress we've made in key priority areas, avoid cuts to core programs, and maintain a $38 billion reserve to safeguard against economic uncertainty, all without the need to raise taxes. I am especially pleased to announce that with the enactment of AB 102, I was able to secure more than $20 million in grants to 19 different agencies throughout Assembly District 40. Grants will be going to the following:
Housing & Homelessness Solutions
Improving Community Health and Wellness
Environment: Water and Fire Protection
Investing in Youth and Family Safety and Security
School Safety and Infrastructure
Each of these recipients provide a valuable service to our community and I’m happy to have secured these one-time infrastructure grant funds. We will continue to be strong advocates in Sacramento to ensure funds are disbursed as quickly as possible.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo’s First Bill Signed by Governor Newsom to Safeguard Seniors and Disabled Communities,2023-07-06,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO - Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that Governor Newsom signed her first bill, Elder and Adult Abuse Reporting (AB 751), aimed at protecting the safety and well-being of California's senior and disabled communities. AB 751 signifies a significant step forward in combating the pervasive issue of abuse targeting these vulnerable populations.
""I'm so proud that our first bill signed by Governor Newsom is AB 751, aimed at protecting the safety of our senior and disabled communities,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. ""This bill earned bipartisan support from my colleagues in the Legislatures because too often, these communities are targeted and preyed upon. It's critical that when abuse is reported, it's investigated. This milestone achievement represents a collective effort to prioritize the safety and security of our senior and disabled populations.”
AB 751 addresses the urgent need for law enforcement agencies to improve their training and investigative protocols concerning abuse inflicted on elderly and disabled people. The legislation mandates that agencies provide comprehensive information and training on various types of abuse, ensuring a more informed and effective response to these distressing incidents.
In California, there are approximately 8.5 million older adults and 9 million people with disabilities, encompassing both adults and children. Unfortunately, these individuals are uniquely susceptible to the harms of abuse and other serious crimes, which often go unreported, uninvestigated, and unpunished. Abuse can manifest in diverse forms, including physical and psychological mistreatment, financial exploitation, and caregiver neglect.
“This is the next, major step toward a revolutionary change in how law enforcement protects California’s 9 million adults and children with disabilities and its 8.5 million older adults.” said Greg deGiere with the Advocates for People with Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities California.
AB 751 also garnered robust support from both senior and disability groups, demonstrating its critical importance in safeguarding these communities.
""We want to thank the Legislature and the Governor for prioritizing the health and safety of all Californians, especially our children, seniors, and people with disabilities with the passage of AB 751. This legislation is pivotal to ensure law enforcement is better equipped with the resources to more equitably protect our most vulnerable communities and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with all stakeholders during the implementation process."" said Dwayne Camp Jr with the California Alliance for Retired Americans.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced today that she successfully advanced six priority bills through Assembly Appropriations Committee. These bills move to the Assembly Floor next for a vote before June 2. If approved by the full Assembly, these bills will move to Senate for consideration. These bills join the additional three bills that have already passed to the Assembly Floor and two more bills that have advanced to the Senate - for a total of eleven bills moving forward this year.
""I am so proud that our office continues to advance solutions to our community's biggest challenges. Delivering on issues like healthcare, housing, homelessness, safe communities, and support for small businesses will allow all families to thrive,"" said Assemblywoman Schiavo. ""I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support.""
The bills that advanced include:
Vital Records Access for Low Income & Unhoused Folks (AB464):
AB 464 provides tools needed for low-income and people experiencing homelessness by eliminating costs for driver's licenses. These are required to access support essential to getting on their feet like employment, safe parking programs, housing, schooling and healthcare. It also eliminates fees for access to vital records such as birth certificates, death records, and marriage or marriage dissolution records for any individual who is a recipient of public assistance.
Streamline Affordable Housing Development Funding (AB 519):
AB 519, approved by the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee with unanimous bipartisan support, will establish an Affordable Housing Finance Workgroup to create a consolidated application for affordable and homeless housing developers. These changes will get housing build faster and prevent increased costs by streamlining a process that, according to a 2020 State Auditor report, creates an unnecessarily cumbersome process that ultimately passes the cost on to taxpayers and those who can least afford it, those occupying affordable units.
Postpartum Parental & Infant Care (AB 608):
AB 608 provides nurturing, supportive, and culturally competent postpartum care from Comprehensive Perinatal Health Workers. This means new moms and babies enrolled in Medi-Cal have care where and when they need it for a full year after a pregnancy ends.
Gun Safety Training for Concealed Carry (AB 1133):
AB 1133 centralizes information on proper concealed carry practices and creates safe statewide testing standards in order to receive or renew a concealed carry gun permit.
Sick Days Nurses and Healthcare Workers (AB 1359):
AB 1359, approved by the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee, will give health workers, who encounter and treat illness every day, additional sick days to ensure healthcare workers, their patients and our communities are protected from unnecessary exposure to illness. AB 1359 details a minimum sick day accrual rate for health workers to ensure they can take their hard-earned sick leave when needed.
Banning Dangerous Chemicals in Astroturf (AB 1423):
Protects the health and safety of young athletes by prohibiting schools, universities, and state or local governments from purchasing or installing Astroturf containing perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as the forever chemical, beginning in 2024. And starting in 2025, AB 1423 prohibits the intentional use of PFAS in any Astroturf product manufactured or sold in the state.

For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo and the Los Angeles County Delegation (LACD) last week voted to extend the California Film and Television Tax Credit Program contained in Governor Newsom's 2023-2024 budget with bipartisan support. The LACD is composed of 39 members, encompassing 15 members from the California State Senate and 24 members from the State Assembly.
""I am proud that my colleagues in the Los Angeles Delegation stand in strong support for extending the California Film and Television Tax Credit Program. Assembly District 40, and especially Santa Clarita, is home to many industry workers, studios and shooting locations who deserve fair contracts, good pay, and economic support. The entertainment industry is such a crucial part of our community and this action will go a long way to ensure its success."" Said Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo.
""Collectively we urge the budget chairs of the Assembly and Senate to include an extension and for the Governor to sign a budget bill that includes the credit.""
A 2022 study by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation found that for every dollar allocated for the tax credit, total economic activity in California will increase by $24.40. Since 2015, this tax credit program has generated $22 billion in economic output and $961 million in revenue generated from state and local taxes. The program has paid out $8.2 billion in qualified wages to 220,000 cast and crew members who have been hired in California, including 1,465,000 background players.

""Today, Governor Newsom released his revision to the 2023-24 Fiscal Year State Budget. As we expected, the revenue forecast is for an even larger shortfall, by $9.3 billion, than initially projected in January.
I am pleased to see the Governor has maintained a commitment to more than $15 billion in funding for solutions to homelessness, including increased funding for health care and mental health services. I also support his proposal for a Behavioral Health Bond. Additionally, I was pleased to see his expressed commitment to addressing the opioid and fentanyl crisis.
Ultimately, it is both houses of the Legislature who will draft a final state budget which is sent to the Governor, so I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Governor to finalize a balanced budget that funds our schools, keeps our communities safe, and protects our most vulnerable.
Given the projected shortfall, we have our work cut out for us, but I am confident we can get this done by the June 15th Constitutional deadline.""

SACRAMENTO – To honor National Fentanyl Awareness Day, yesterday Assemblywoman Schiavo joined a legislative press conference to offer her support for the bipartisan solutions moving forward in the legislature to tackle the fentanyl crisis. Her support includes co-authoring AB 19, a bill which will ensure naloxone hydrochloride, also referred to as NARCAN, is available in our schools.
As the Assemblywoman said at the press conference yesterday, ""As a mom, it is terrifying to think about what my daughter will face in the near future going into middle school and high school. This is truly a crisis that we are committed to addressing, to solving, and to making a difference on in a real way. We need to focus on things that are actually going to make an impact and change people's lives and prevent these tragedies from happening in our communities. That's one of the reasons I'm co-authoring AB 19, so schools are able to respond to the crises we are too often seeing in our schools and with our students.""
Last year, 6,843 people died in California from opioid overdose and more than 83% of these deaths were related to Fentanyl. AB 19, the fentanyl bill Assemblywoman Schiavo is co-authoring, will require each public school to maintain at least two doses of naloxone hydrochloride on its campus. Naloxone is a medicine that rapidly reverses an opioid overdose, quickly restoring normal breathing to a person if their breathing has slowed or stopped because of an opioid overdose.
Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo was elected to the California State Assembly in November of 2022 to represent the 40th Assembly District, representing the Northwest San Fernando Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley. Upon her election, she was appointed as Assistant Majority Whip by the Speaker of the Assembly. Prior to her election, Assemblywoman Schiavo was a Nurse Advocate and Small Business Owner who worked in the labor movement for more than 20 years. Throughout her career, Assemblywoman Schiavo helped deliver healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, to more than one million people. In the Northwest San Fernando Valley, she co-founded an organization that helped secure housing for Veterans experiencing homelessness, has delivered more than 50,000 meals to people in need, and increased resources to help keep our communities safe. Assemblywoman Schiavo lives in Chatsworth with her daughter Sofia where they love to hike in the Santa Susana Mountains.

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Schiavo Announces Electrified Roads and EV & Infrastructure Select Committee to Focus on Achieving a Zero Emissions in Transportation Sector,2023-03-09,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblywoman Schiavo announced her appointment as Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Electric Vehicles (EV) and Charging Infrastructure, as well as the introduction of electrified roads and parking lot legislation aimed at opening new possibilities to address the growing need for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Both her appointment and the legislation she introduced are focused on the goal of achieving a zero emissions transportation sector in California.
Currently, there are 36 million registered vehicles in California. Based on estimates produced by the California Air Resources Board, 5 million zero emission vehicles would require 700,000 public chargers and 8 million would require 1.2 million shared chargers. As of 2021, there were only 70,000 public EV chargers with another 123,000 planned. The bill Schiavo introduced, AB 823, would expand the scope of existing clean transportation programs run by the state to include new and innovative approaches to charge electric vehicles while driving on roads or parked.
“As an early adopter of an electric vehicle, this issue is very personal. If EVs are going to be a centerpiece of our transition to a zero emission transportation sector, California must undergo an energy revolution. Apart from the sheer magnitude of charging infrastructure needed, California must thoroughly consider equity in deployment,” said Schiavo. “Not all renters or older apartments can cheaply or easily accommodate charging, the range of electric vehicles can create hurdles for rural communities and long distance driving, and utility companies will be under pressure to quickly connect charging infrastructure to the grid. As Chair of the Select Committee dedicated to these issues, I fully intend to open this conversation in order to ensure the Legislature works toward practical solutions informed by conversations as broad reaching as possible,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo.
One innovative approach is being deployed in Sweden and now for the first time domestically in Detroit, Michigan, which is investing in pilot programs to evaluate the potential of electric roads. These roads are a new technology providing both charging flexibility and integration with the road network and parking lots that, if deployed strategically, could address many of the equity concerns surrounding current EV charging. AB 823 opens up the potential to fund similar projects in California.
“Electric roads are an innovative approach worth investigating, but they are not the end all be all. To address the complex issue of reaching zero emission transportation in California, we must consider numerous technologies, align with other efforts in the zero emission vehicle space, and support businesses leading the way in making the transition. I’m excited to sign in to this work and make sure we are supporting all of California’s communities in bringing forward a healthier and greener future.”

Pilar Schiavo,Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo Introduces Additional Legislation Aimed at Housing Affordability,2023-03-01,press_release,NA,"For LA County Wildfire Resources, please click here.
For help with your EDD case, please click here.
SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblywoman Schiavo announced two additional pieces of legislation aimed at housing affordability. The first bill, AB 911, would remove cumbersome barriers for affordable housing developers by removing restrictions ahead of purchasing property for development. The second bill, AB 1014, would expand property tax credits available to veterans in an effort to keep housing costs manageable and keep our veterans housed.
The announcement of these two bills comes on the heels of the Assemblywoman’s announcement of her bill focused on funding affordable housing development for former foster youth (AB 963), as well as a bill package to address real solutions to homelessness.
“Our community has been struggling for far too long with the cost of housing. Once a place where people moved for affordable homes, families are now priced out of our region. That is unacceptable, and I intend to do all I can to ensure everyone has the ability to afford a place they can call home,” said Assemblywoman Schiavo. “These two bills we are announcing today address historic barriers to housing, aiming to boost the supply of housing people can afford and support veteran homeowners.”
For decades, some neighborhoods have included historic restrictions, known as covenants on properties that limit the allowable density or number of units permitted on a property, even when they may conflict with local zoning ordinances. While recent 2021 legislation (Bloom AB 721) has forged a path for removing these restrictions for 100% affordable housing, developers must own the property before seeking to remove the covenant. For some developers, this creates uncertainty in a process that sometimes requires millions of dollars in investment to address an administrative hurdle. AB 911 allows for a process of removing these restrictions for prospective buyers, while preserving local control and zoning, and also providing confidence to investors that they can build affordable housing on the properties they acquire.
Affordable housing is critical for all. Unfortunately, veterans face an increased risk of homelessness. To help address this, veterans qualify for two separate tax credits, the Homeowners Exemption and the Veterans Exemption. These exemptions help lower the assessed value of a home, saving homeowners annually on their property taxes. However, veterans are limited to choosing one of the two exemptions they qualify for. If passed, AB 1014 will allow Veterans to combine both homeowner tax credits to increase their savings on property taxes. This will help combat homelessness and foreclosures.
“We urgently need affordable housing to address our housing crisis. Uncertainty in affordable housing construction delays projects and prolongs the homelessness crisis. AB 911 aims to change that,” continued Schiavo. “And with AB 1014, we are addressing a major issue for those that have served our nation: housing insecurity. This legislation will allow veterans additional financial help when they need it most - to secure home ownership.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Broadband Internet Affordability Bill Advances,2025-04-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assembly Bill (AB) 353 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) passed the Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee. AB 353 would require internet service providers operating in California to offer affordable home internet to eligible California residents. Despite heavy opposition from the telecommunications, cable, and broadband industry, the vote was 7-2. This legislation is especially timely, following the loss of federally funded broadband subsidies through the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The ACP benefited approximately three million California households in 2024, and this bill will help address the gap left by the lack of federal action.
“The time is right! Californians are struggling with the high cost of living. Three million Californians who relied on federal support to afford their broadband bills will be left in the dark because Congress failed to continue the program. People without affordable access to broadband internet are painfully aware. Children can’t turn in their homework, people cannot access telehealth appointments, and people cannot apply for jobs online,” stated Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “I want to thank my colleagues on the Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee who supported this bill today and the Speaker for making this a priority bill for his affordability package. Broadband affordability is not an urban versus rural issue, nor does it have to be a partisan issue. We all should agree that broadband is an essential service that must be affordable for all.”

Tasha Boerner,California Moves to Ban Toxic Plastic Microbeads in Cleaning Products and Coatings,2025-02-21,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA – Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) introduced new legislation to ban plastic microbeads in cleaning products, leave-on cosmetics, and paints, targeting a persistent source of toxic microplastic pollution. AB 823, co-sponsored by The 5 Gyres Institute, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, Californians Against Waste, and Clean Water Action, would prevent trillions of plastic particles from entering the environment and posing risks to public health.
“This is very much a movie becoming reality. Plastic has overtaken our world, from the soil that grows our food to the water we drink, the air we breathe, and even the products we use daily. With AB 823, California is taking a big step by banning personal care and household products that threaten our health and the environment. We all deserve a cleaner, healthier world free from microplastic pollution,” stated Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “I am excited to work with some excellent environmental champions who will help me to get this bill to the finish line. A microplastic-free future is possible.”
A 2023 study found that household cleaning products alone release 40 trillion microplastic particles each year. Microplastics have been detected in human lungs, the bloodstream, placentas, and even brain tissue, raising serious concerns among researchers. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have suggested potential links between exposure to microplastics and the onset of various chronic diseases. Microplastics trigger uncontrolled cell proliferation and ensue tissue growth leading to various cancers affecting the lungs, blood, breasts, prostate, and ovaries.
California banned plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products in 2015, but the law left out leave-on personal care products, cleaning products, industrial detergents, and coatings, which continue to release millions of tons of plastic into the environment.
Supporters of the bill point out that alternatives to plastic microbeads already exist, like, coconut shells, sand, and salt, making their continued use unnecessary. Businesses in support comment on the bill: ""At Grove, we believe in taking bold action to eliminate plastic pollution at its source. The 2015 microbead ban was an important first step, but expanding it to include other products is essential to ensure that plastic pollution does not cause harm to our families, our communities, and our planet. We’re proud to support this legislation and advocate for policies that drive systemic change, reinforcing our commitment to environmental sustainability and human health. By closing these loopholes, we can help ensure California remains at the forefront of the fight against microplastic pollution,"" says Alexandra Bede, the Director of Sustainability at Grove Collaborative.
If passed, AB 823 would prohibit the sale and distribution of plastic microbeads in leave-on cosmetics, cleaning products, and coatings, ensuring that fewer microplastics enter California’s waterways, ecosystems, and bodies.
Co-sponsoring organizations comment on the bill:
“Plastic microbeads are an unnecessary and preventable source of pollution,” said Nancy Buermeyer, Director of Program and Policy, at Breast Cancer Prevention Partners. “These tiny plastics act like sponges, absorbing toxic chemicals. They then make their way into our bodies through inhalation, ingestion, and skin exposure. Microplastics contribute to cancers affecting the breasts, ovaries, lungs, blood and prostate. Banning them is a commonsense step to protect public health.”
“California already banned plastic microbeads for rinse-off, but why we still allowing them in certain household products? Research links microplastic exposure to a range of health issues, and removing them is vital to safeguard public health and prevent long-term harm,” said Alison Waliszewski, Director of Regional Policy & Program Development at The 5 Gyres Institute. “We applaud Assemblymember Boerner for advancing solutions that protect California’s water, ecosystems, and public health.”
“Californians should not have to worry that the microplastics in their household products are going to end up in their bodies,” said Krystal Raynes, Legislative Associate at Californians Against Waste. “AB 823 holds the industry accountable for reducing plastic pollution at its source.”
“Californians should not have to worry that products they buy are polluting waterways and drinking water sources with microplastics,” said Andria Ventura, Legislative and Policy Director at Clean Water Action. “This bill will close a dangerous loophole and ensure that companies use safer, non-toxic alternatives.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Addresses Broadband Internet Affordability,2025-01-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) introduced Assembly Bill (AB) 353, mandating that internet service providers make affordable home internet plans available to California residents. This legislation comes at a pivotal time as roughly three million California households lost federal support through the Affordable Connectivity (ACP) benefit in 2024. According to a recent report from the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, affordability remains a major barrier to broadband internet access. 
“Right now, families are struggling to afford essential services, like the internet. Households in our state don’t have support to pay for a basic home internet service plan. We are talking about kids not being able to do homework at home, parents having to go to libraries to apply for jobs, and people not having access to do basic things, like telehealth,” stated Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “As the Chair of the Communications & Conveyance Committee, I have supported legislation to address broadband affordability, but none of those bills have been signed into law. AB 353 will ensure all California’s families can connect to the internet.”
“We applaud Assemblymember Boerner for introducing AB 353, which aims to establish a clear path for every Californian to have a fast, affordable, and reliable internet option,” said Shayna Englin, Director of the California Community Foundation Digital Equity Initiative, on behalf of the California Alliance for Digital Equity (CADE). “The introduction of this bill offers the legislature an opportunity to swiftly respond to the cost-of-living crisis plaguing residents and reduce their financial burdens long-term. We look forward to working with the Assemblymember to develop and pass the legislation.” 
“Finding the right solution for California will require thoughtful engagement and collaboration from all sides of this issue,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “It will be one of my priorities to work collaboratively with my colleagues, consumer advocates, industry stakeholders, and the Governor’s office to ensure we get this solution to the finish line.”

“The Trump Administration’s radical and retaliatory move to pause all grants and federal assistance will only negatively affect California’s ability to achieve bipartisan goals like constructing infrastructure and connecting families to high-speed, affordable broadband internet. We have been working with various departments for years now to use the $6.75 billion we were awarded by the federal government to get families connected to the internet, especially those who are living in the most rural areas of California. These federal tax dollars, paid by families in our state, should benefit the programs for which they were intended. I, along with all my colleagues, will fight to ensure our federal tax dollars are expeditiously invested in California and our families.”

“The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to not review the industry’s challenge to the New York broadband affordability law shows that states have the authority to implement bold and innovative solutions to ensure affordable access to essential services, like the internet. As Chair of the Assembly Committee on Communications & Conveyance, I have supported legislation aimed at addressing the broadband affordability crisis. Unfortunately, none of those bills have been signed into law.

I look forward to working collaboratively with my colleagues, digital equity advocates, industry stakeholders, and the Governor’s office to ensure we find the right solution for California.
Californians have been voicing their concerns about the rising costs of basic services, like electricity and broadband internet. As a state, we must do everything in our power to ensure we are addressing these real affordability issues. At the end of the day, our goal should be to ensure that every single person has access to the internet and can afford it.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill on E-Bike Safety Signed by the Governor,2024-09-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — In an effort to prevent e-bike accidents for children, Assembly Bill (AB) 2234 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 2234 would establish an opt-in program for cities in the County of San Diego to prohibit children under 12 from riding a class 1 or 2 e-bike.
“E-bikes are an amazing way for our kids to get around, but they need to be at an age where they can ride defensively and correctly navigate through large streets, intersections, cars, and pedestrians. The data shows that kids on e-bikes under 12 have the greatest number of accidents and risk of severe injuries,” stated Assemblymember Boerner.
According to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, there were 3,945 e-bike injuries between 2011 and 2020. The e-bike injuries increased over time during the study period, with the 10-13 year old age group making up 44% of those injuries.
“As a mother and someone who has worked on this issue area for several years, kids need to know the rules of the road and have the maturity to navigate their e-bike. The best way to keep our children safe is to keep them on a traditional bike until they are twelve,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “I want to thank the Governor for supporting AB 2234. We need to protect our kids when they are on the streets, and AB 2234 will do just that.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill to Reduce Utility Rates is Signed by the Governor,2024-09-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — To help Californians who are struggling to pay their utility bills, today, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill (AB) 2666 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas). AB 2666 would require the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to determine if rates were reasonably set for investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and adjust the approved rate of return downward at the next general rate case if the IOU made excess profits at the previous general rate case.
“Californians are fed up with high utility prices, and I am so happy to announce that the Governor signed AB 2666 to stand with hardworking Californians who are struggling with our state’s high cost of living. The CPUC needs to be held accountable for the sky-high rates they are approving and expecting Californians to pay,” stated Assemblymember Boerner.
According to the California State Auditor’s August 2023 report, “Electricity and Natural Gas Rates,” some IOUs were generating profits above their approved rate of return. The audit found an electricity rate increase between 16 percent and 23 percent from 2022 to 2023 by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). Within the same year, these utility companies raised natural gas prices between 27 percent and 162 percent.
“Utility prices should be affordable for Californians because it is the right thing to do. We should not let investor-owned utility corporations profit off hardworking Californians,” said Assemblymember Boerner.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Hosts Menopause Webinar with Women’s Health Experts,2024-09-18,press_release,NA,"SOLANA BEACH, CA. — Last night, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) hosted a webinar for women experiencing menopause and perimenopause symptoms with three renowned women’s health experts.
“Women often get lumped together in a single category when each of our experiences through menopause are so different. We each have our own health profile and should be treated that way when we go to the doctor,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “The amount of information about menopause perimenopause can be confusing. I wanted to make sure women had access to information about menopause from key experts so that when they go to the doctor they have a better understanding of their symptoms and options available to them.”
“Throughout menopause, hormones are changing and finding a treatment that works best can take time,” said Dr. Kathryn Macaulay. “Women have always been going through menopause, there is still little research that has been done on this topic. That is why it is so important to talk about menopause. The more we talk about it, the more women feel empowered to have these conversations with their doctor and the better we all are for it.”
“While there are many hormone replacement therapies that are widely accessible to women, I recommend taking a holistic approach to your health. It is important to evaluate your diet to ensure that you are receiving the essential nutrients that can support you throughout menopause. Additionally, considering supplementary options may be beneficial to help ease the hormonal fluctuations that can trigger a variety of symptoms. I am committed to ensuring that women are fully informed about all the available options for their optimal health,” said Dr. Rubaina Dang.
“Women represent half of the workforce and half of those women are in either perimenopause or menopause. Unfortunately, less than 5 percent of those women receive hormone therapy and the vast majority of the remaining women aren’t treated, resulting in them bringing their symptoms to work. That is estimated to cost businesses over $180 billion dollars annually in lost productivity and causes women to have less job satisfaction, not seek advancement opportunities, and in ten percent of cases, drop out of the workforce. We discussed these issues and offer actionable approaches to make businesses more menopause friendly,” stated Dr. Mache Seibel.
“I want to thank Dr. Kathryn Macaulay, Dr. Rubaina Dang, and Dr. Mache Seibel, for spending the evening with me and my constituents. I want to thank all of the experts for sharing their knowledge to help women learn more about an issue that affects all of us at some point,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill to Prioritize Postpartum Health Signed by the Governor,2024-08-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assembly Bill (AB) 2756, aimed at postpartum recovery by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas), was signed by the Governor. AB 2756 would establish a pilot program for pelvic floor and core conditioning group classes for birthing people between their six-to-twelve-week postpartum window in the County of San Diego.
“Right now, postpartum care is too difficult and complicated to access after childbirth. From a lack of professionals certified in pelvic floor exercises to minimal education regarding changes the body undergoes after childbirth. Recovering from birth in this country is a struggle,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “Thanks to the Governor’s support of AB 2756, California won’t be abandoning new parents postpartum, but continuing to support them on their healing journey.”
According to the University of California, Los Angeles Health, one in three people who give birth will experience pelvic floor disorder in their lifetime. Currently, most postpartum check-ups are focused on a urine exam, mental health, and a brief pelvic examination but fail to address the anatomical changes that take place on the pelvic floor, ultimately leading to urinary continence, pelvic organ prolapse, and low back pain, among others.
In California, Scripps Health in San Diego is one of few healthcare systems currently providing pelvic floor and core conditioning physical therapy.
“AB 2756 will make pelvic floor physical therapy the standard for birthing Californians in the future,” stated Assemblymember Boerner.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Gives Backpacks and School Supplies to Families in San Diego,2024-08-03,press_release,NA,"SOLANA BEACH, CA. — To ensure students have all the materials needed for a successful school year, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) and the Boys and Girls Club (BGC) of Northwest San Diego hosted a Backpack and School Supplies Giveaway and provided over 200 students with backpacks and school supplies.
“I know how hectic it can be to get our children back-to-school ready. I am currently making sure both of my children are ready for the new school year, and it can be stressful and expensive. While our parents and guardians are worrying about their students’ success, we want them to know that they can count on us for support.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Secures State Funding for Continuous Coverage of Children Enrolled in Medi-Cal,2024-06-27,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — After working on legislation to protect those eligible for Medi-Cal from gaps in enrollment, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) was able to work with her colleagues to secure state funds, protecting Medi-Cal coverage for zero to five year-olds.
During the pandemic, the state adopted federal flexibilities to remove unnecessary barriers and bureaucratic red tape in the renewal process to ensure those enrolled in Medi-Cal kept their access to lifesaving healthcare. As of June 2023, redeterminations have returned with the federal flexibilities expected to sunset on December 2024. As of November 2023, just a few months after California tolled back those federal flexibilities, 92% of Californians have been procedurally disenrolled, a third of whom are children. 
“Thousands of children in California are at risk of being disenrolled over clerical errors. Parents are taking their children to doctor appointments only to find out that their child is no longer covered by Medi-Cal. These are families who likely have other challenges in their lives, and I am happy that as a state we are ensuring they have access to healthcare,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “I am incredibly grateful to my colleagues and the Governor for approving funding that will ensure children in our state have positive health outcomes.”
""We applaud the governor and legislature for making investments in the ‘24-’25 state budget to keep kids covered. Latine children make up over half of school children in California. By promoting the health and well-being of children 0-5, we are ensuring the well-being of millions of California families. The Latine community continues to be the most impacted by the Medi-Cal disenrollment crisis, with over 800,000 disenrollments in the last 12 months. We look forward to ensuring these investments reach every child and family, and the continued work to extend federal flexibilities to improve Medi-Cal renewals that will advance health equity in our state,"" stated Mar Velez, Director of Policy for Latino Coalition for a Healthy California.
""We are grateful that the legislature and governor prioritized protecting children's coverage in this tough budget. With over 350,000 children having lost coverage in the last 11 months, this protection can’t come soon enough to ensure our littlest ones can get their check ups, screenings and immunizations for their healthy early childhood development. Now, we need the state to immediately request federal approval and take the necessary steps to strengthen Medi-Cal and start this protection,"" stated Mayra E. Alvarez, President of The Children's Partnership.
“Western Center is thrilled that California’s budget includes multi-year Medi-Cal eligibility for children ages 0-5. This ensures young children do not experience gaps in health care during this critical development time -- setting up our kids for future success.” Linda Nguy, Western Center on Law and Poverty.
In addition to securing Medi-Cal continuous eligibility for zero to five year-olds, Assemblymember Boerner also secured funding for the Property Tax Postponement Fund for seniors and disabled citizens struggling to help Californians stay in their homes, and worked with her colleagues to maximize federal dollars for broadband, thus saving the state millions for vital state programs.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Recognizes La Jolla Playhouse for California Nonprofits Day,2024-06-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, La Jolla Playhouse was recognized as the 77th Assembly District’s 2024 Nonprofit of the Year by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas). Each year, California Assemblymembers and State Senators select nonprofits from their district to be recognized for their work to provide services to those in need, promote social change, and improve the quality of life in their communities.
 “La Jolla Playhouse is a jewel in San Diego and has contributed to the artistic culture of the region. If you want to see what is next in the American theatre landscape, it is happening at La Jolla Playhouse,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “I am incredibly proud of the creativity that comes from this place and the many programs that they provide to keep our youth engaged with the arts.”
“It is truly an honor to be named the 77th Assembly District Nonprofit of the Year. Throughout our history, La Jolla Playhouse has strived to be a leader in the theatre industry through a steadfast commitment to developing new plays and musicals for San Diego and beyond. Equally as important has been our connection to the community through a multitude of Learning and Engagement programs, as well as the annual WOW Festival, and we deeply appreciate this recognition by Assemblymember Boerner,” said La Jolla Playhouse Managing Director, Debby Buchholz.

Tasha Boerner,Legislation on Utility Rate Adjustments by Assemblymember Boerner Passes Assembly Floor,2024-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — As Californians attempt to seek financial relief from high utility rates, Assembly Bill (AB) 2666 on Utility Rate Adjustments by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner passed the Assembly Floor. AB 2666 would require the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to determine if rates were reasonably set and adjust accordingly.
Following constituents concerns over the rate hikes imposed by San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E), Assemblymember Boerner requested an audit of the CPUC and the California Public Advocates Office in 2022. The audit found electricity rates increased between 16 percent and 23 percent from 2022 to 2023 by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and SDG&E. That same year, these utility companies raised their natural gas prices between 27 percent and 162 percent. The state audit concluded that the CPUC must do better at protecting customers by increasing transparency and oversight of utility companies.
“Utility companies are making record profits as hardworking Californians look for ways to cut costs. With the cost of living going up, Californians are begging for relief. Families cannot afford to keep their lights on and feed their kids. Many are a month or more behind on paying their bills,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “As the commission in charge of approving rate increases, the CPUC must also keep in mind the struggle of our working families and not prioritize the profits of investment-owned utility companies over ratepayers.”
AB 2666 passed the Assembly with 52 votes and is moving forward to the Senate.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill to Restore Coastal Wetlands Advances,2024-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assembly Bill (AB) 1992 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, a bill that would require coastal development permit applicants to contribute to promoting blue carbon projects if they affect coastal habitats, passed the Assembly Floor.
Recent studies on the importance of conserving coastal ecosystems have concluded that coastal wetlands can store five times more carbon than tropical rainforests and 50 times more in their surrounding soil. Blue carbon is the process by which carbon is captured by ocean and coastal ecosystems. Unfortunately, coastal habitats around the world, including California, are being lost at a rapid rate, mainly due to coastal development. 
“California has lost over 90 percent of its historical wetlands,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “Despite the damages done through development, we can work to restore these ecosystems with legislation like AB 1992. Blue carbon is essential in protecting our coastal communities from the harmful impacts of the climate crisis. Through the restoration of blue carbon, we can ensure long-term conservation of these habitats and build our state’s climate resiliency.”
AB 1992 will ensure that the state actively safeguards the unique biodiversity of our marine life despite development.
AB 1992 passed the Assembly Floor with 53 votes and is headed to the Senate.

Tasha Boerner,E-Bike Safety Bill by Assemblymember Boerner Passes Assembly Floor During National Bike Month,2024-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assembly Bill (AB) 2234 on E-Bike Safety Training by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner passed the Assembly Floor. This critical legislation comes forward as the state commemorates National Bike Month. AB 2234 would ensure the safety of children by allowing cities in San Diego County to prohibit children under the age of 12 from riding a class one or two e-bike as a pilot program.
While e-bike usage has increased, e-bike injuries have also become more common. With the increased number of e-bikes on the road, these injuries have occurred more frequently and resulted in severe injuries and even deaths. E-bike injuries have become more prevalent than traditional bicycle injuries, with children 13 years and under making up the majority of e-bike injuries requiring a hospital visit. According to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, there were 3,945 e-bike injuries between 2011 and 2020. The e-bike injuries increased over time during the study period, with the 10-13 year old age group making up 44% of those injuries. Children under the age of 14 made up 72% of e-bike injuries over the study period.
“As a mother, I believe that we must act to prevent our youth from injuries and educate parents on the benefits and responsibility of e-bikes, and AB 2234 takes a step to increase their safety while sharing the road. Given the increase of e-bike incidents that have taken place in our communities, it becomes the responsibility of the community and the state to ensure not another one of our children is seriously injured,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “Through education and redirection, not punishment, we can teach young riders to take responsibility for their safety and the safety of others on the road.”
AB 2234 is moving forward and is headed to the Senate.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill to Prioritize Postpartum Health Passes Assembly Floor,2024-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assembly Bill (AB) 2756 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner passed the Assembly Floor with a 73 to 7 vote and is headed to the Senate. AB 2756 would establish a pilot program for pelvic floor and core conditioning group classes for birthing people between their six-to-twelve-week postpartum window.
“For far too long, conversations surrounding childbearing and postpartum recovery have been considered taboo. Many people are suffering in silence or are unaware of the physical changes to their bodies after childbirth. A weak pelvic floor can lead to many physical complications if left untreated. This problem disproportionately impacts women of color and those without comprehensive healthcare coverage,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “We have programs to support parents before they give birth, and we should have programs to support them postpartum.”
According to UCLA Health, one in three people who give birth will experience pelvic floor disorder (PFD) in their lifetime. Currently, most postpartum check-ups are focused on a urine exam, mental health, and a brief pelvic examination, but fail to address the anatomical changes that take place on the pelvic floor, ultimately leading to urinary continence, pelvic organ prolapse, and low back pain, among others.
In California, Scripps Health in San Diego is one of few healthcare systems currently providing pelvic floor and core conditioning.
“We need to prioritize postpartum care. Pelvic floor physical therapy should be the standard of care,” stated Assemblymember Boerner. “AB 2756 will help collect the necessary data in San Diego County and improve maternal health outcomes ultimately in California.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner’s Bills to Lower Utility Rates Clears First Hurdle,2024-04-25,press_release,NA,"
 
 
SACRAMENTO, CA. — Today, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s legislation to protect consumers and reduce electric and gas prices, Assembly Bill (AB) 2666 and AB 2683, has cleared the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Energy.
“It’s unconscionable that while utility companies are making record profits over the allowed rate set by the California Public Utilities Commission, Californians are seeing the cost of gas and electricity increase year after year. San Diego County already pays the second highest utility rates in the nation,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “With the cost of living going up yearly, every dollar counts. Californians should not have to ask themselves whether or not they can afford to keep the lights on, or buy groceries for their children.”
Recognizing the negative impact of continuous rate hikes, in 2022, Assemblymember Boerner requested an audit of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Public Advocates Office (Cal Advocates). The audit found an electricity rate increase between 16 percent and 23 percent from 2022 to 2023 by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). Within the same year, these three utility companies raised natural gas prices between 27 percent and 162 percent. While projected program and improvement costs justified rate increases, the audit noted a lack of processes to protect consumers from exaggerated cost estimates. SDG&E reported earnings higher than the CPUC-authorized rate of return for nine out of the ten years.
AB 2666 would require the CPUC to review actual utility costs compared to the authorized rate of return, and align future authorized revenues based on the past costs that were recorded. The companion bill, AB 2683, would require Cal Advocates to push for lower utility rates every time rate increases are proposed.
“The CPUC and Cal Advocates need to do more to protect consumers,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “My bills, AB 2666 and AB 2683, will result in lower utility rates for all Californians and put in place clear expectations on the oversight commission, state-funded consumer advocates, and utility companies that are making profits on the backs of hard-working families.”

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Boerner Announces E-Bike Safety Training Bill,2024-02-09,press_release,NA,"SOLANA BEACH, Calif. — Following a series of traffic-related injuries and deaths, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) announces the introduction of AB 2234 to ensure the safety of electric bicycle (e-bike) riders and those who share the roads.
The bill will require anyone over the age of 12 without a valid driver’s license to take an online e-bike safety training course and pass a written test to prove they understand traffic safety rules. Those without a valid driver’s license must have a state-issued ID in order to operate an e-bike. AB 2234 will also prohibit children under the age of 12 from operating e-bikes.
E-bikes are becoming an increasingly common environmentally-friendly mode of transportation for both recreation and commuting, especially for children and adults who do not drive. However, concerns about e-bike safety have been raised due to the maximum speed that they are able to attain, up to 28 miles per hour for a class 3 e-bike.
While e-bike usage has increased, e-bike injuries have also become more common. With the increased number of e-bikes on the road, these injuries have occurred more frequently and resulted in more serious injuries and even deaths. In fact, e-bike injuries have become more prevalent than traditional bicycle injuries, with children 13 years and under making up the majority of e-bike injuries requiring a hospital visit. According to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, there were 3945 e-bike injuries between 2011 and 2020. The e-bike injuries increased over time during the study period with the 10-13 year old age group making up 44% of those injuries. Children under the age of 14 made up 72% of e-bike injuries over the study period.
“Owning and riding an e-bike is a big responsibility, and it is crucial that children and their parents understand the liability they take on when they get on an e-bike that can go nearly 30 miles per hour,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “As an avid cyclist and a mother, my goal is to ensure that California’s young riders are educated on the rules of the road to increase their safety and the safety of other road users.”
“The City of Carlsbad was the first in the region to pass local e-bike safety laws, and now we are proud to partner with Assemblymember Boerner on another first, this time at the state level,” said City of Carlsbad Mayor Keith Blackburn. “As a former police officer, I have seen the devastation of traffic fatalities firsthand. We need to do everything we can to prepare young e-bike riders to ride safely on our streets.”
“The popularity of e-bikes is growing across age groups and abilities, and it is paramount for policymakers to create methods for them to co-exist with pedestrians as a safe mobility option,” said San Diego City Council President Pro Tem Joe LaCava. “In partnership with local organizations and leaders like Assemblymember Boerner, we can educate the public on responsible ridership and provide new opportunities for access and travel across San Diego.”
“Solana Beach is grateful for Assemblymember Boerner’s leadership in bringing this e-bike safety bill,” said Solana Beach City Councilmember Kristi Becker. “Solana Beach looks forward to implementing any and all measures that will ensure the safe movement of people through all modes of travel.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor Signing AB 399
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor signed AB 399, her bill requiring, as a condition of detachment for any public agency organized under the County Water Authority Act, that a majority of the voters within its jurisdiction vote to approve the detachment at a scheduled election.
“AB 399 is a good governance bill that seeks to give ratepayers a voice in decisions that impact the cost of one of their most basic needs: water. A recent decision by San Diego LAFCO exposed a glaring shortcoming in the process required for an agency to detach from the County Water Authority (CWA). The exit fees set by LAFCO for two agencies seeking detachment were far too low - almost $165 million too low by some estimates - and people throughout San Diego County will be forced to make up the difference in the form of higher monthly bills. 
AB 399 will ensure ratepayers are protected by giving them a voice in decisions like these in the form of their vote. I was ecstatic to see this signed by the Governor today because it provides a necessary safeguard for families throughout San Diego County just trying to make ends meet.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor Signing AB 812
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor signed AB 812, her bill authorizing cities and/ or counties to set aside up to 10 percent of very low, low, or moderate-income housing units for working artists if they are within, or within one-half mile, of a state-designated cultural district or within the boundaries of a locally-designated cultural district.
“Artists often represent the lifeblood of our communities and help inform, document, and celebrate our cultural footprint. California has established 14 state-designated cultural districts and hundreds of locally-designated cultural districts to help preserve and highlight some of our state’s unique cultural and artistic communities, but too often, the very artists critical to the mission of these districts are priced out of living there.
That is why I was overjoyed to see the Governor sign my bill, AB 812, which will allow local governments that have worked to establish these cultural districts to set aside a portion of affordable housing units for the working artists so essential to nurturing and growing these communities.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor Signing AB 548
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor signed her bill requiring local agencies to develop procedures for expanding code enforcement inspections when an enforcement officer determines that the defects or violations can reasonably affect other units in the building.
“For our local code enforcement officers to inspect and act on unhealthy or unsafe living conditions often requires someone to file a complaint, but when it comes to buildings like apartments, that complaint usually only applies to the one tenant’s unit. Problems like mold or mildew can trigger asthma, respiratory infections, or worse, and they do not respect barriers like the walls between apartments.
That is why I was pleased to see the Governor sign AB 548 into law today. This bill will help ensure local enforcement officers can access other units when there are clear, reasonable signs that an unhealthy living condition in one may be impacting others.
Unhealthy housing is far too common in vulnerable communities throughout California. With the Governor’s action today, we are making it easier to tackle a very real public health threat that disproportionately impacts those most in need of an affordable place to live.”

Governor Signs Assemblymember Boerner’s Bill Ending Surprise Billing for Ambulance Services
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Governor Newsom signed AB 716, a bill by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D – Encinitas) which will end “surprise” billing for ground ambulance services in California.
“The last thing anyone should be thinking about when they call 911 is whether they can afford the ambulance ride,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “With the Governor’s approval, AB 716 prevents consumers from being hit with those surprise bills for ground ambulance service, protect the uninsured, and help ensure that the costs are better covered for the heroic work of our firefighters and paramedics.”
A surprise bill happens when a person does the right thing by seeking in-network care but is unknowingly seen by an out-of-network provider for a service. In the case of ambulances, consumers have no choice whether the ambulance that arrives is contracted with their health plan, often resulting in a surprise bill because the consumer ends up having to make up the difference between what their health plan will pay and what the ambulance provider is charging.
AB 716 ends this practice by holding the consumer responsible only for the in-network cost-sharing amount (e.g. their co-pay) required by their health plan, and uninsured Californians can only be charged the Medi-Cal or Medicare rate for the service, whichever is greater. It also ensures ambulance providers have their costs better covered by requiring that, absent a contract between the provider and the insurer, health plans will pay the ambulance providers at rates negotiated and set locally through city or regional governments (also known as the Local Emergency Medical Authority or LEMSA rate).
""With Governor Newsom’s signature of AB 716, Californians are finally protected from the trauma of being hit with a large ambulance bill after already facing the trauma of an emergency,"" said Katie Van Deynze, policy and legislative advocate with Health Access California, the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition which sponsored the bill. ""We’ve heard from Californians across the state who have been hit with these unexpected bills when a family member needed an ambulance. People think it’s a mistake because they have insurance, only to find out that California law allows these large bills to be charged to consumers, and they have to figure out how to pay it. Some consumers may decide to not call an ambulance in the next emergency. This new law will provide direct benefits to millions of Californians, giving them the peace of mind to know that they can call 911 in an emergency without the threat of a huge surprise bill."" 
AB 716 will take effect on January 1st, 2024.

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor Signing AB 1294
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor signed her bill to allow some of the same vendor advertising rights at a competitive surfing facility that are common at other professional sport venues.
“Surfing as a sport has millions of fans around the globe, and it is the official state sport of California. While many surfing competitions take place on beaches up and down our state and around the world, there are wave basins like Surf Ranch in Lemoore, CA that also host surfing competitions in regions not typically known for surfing.
Since its inception in 2015, Surf Ranch has hosted surfers from around the world at competitive events, attracting thousands of visitors to King’s County and local businesses, while also creating close to a hundred full and part-time jobs. This includes the Surf Ranch Pro, one of the major stops on the World Surf League’s professional surfing tour.
I authored AB 1294 to ensure that Surf Ranch has access to the same types of financial opportunities we provide any other professional sports venue in our state, including potential revenue from alcoholic beverage advertising. I am grateful for the Governor’s signature on this bill and hope that it helps keep Surf Ranch thriving by supporting the local economy and promoting the great sport of surfing.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor’s Veto of AB 265
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor vetoed her bill to ensure funding for the Property Tax Postponement (PTP) program.
“Property Tax Postponement (PTP) is a successful resource that, since 1977, has allowed low-income seniors and those who are disabled in our communities to defer their property tax bill so they can afford to stay in their homes. The program’s current funding structure is at risk of running at a deficit, which means no new applicants would be allowed. 
AB 265 sought to remedy that by allowing the State Controller to make transfers from the General Fund necessary to keep the program running in years where a shortfall would occur. While I understand the Governor’s overall concern with the budget and the reason for his veto, this program helps protect some of the most vulnerable people in our state from falling into homelessness and merits funding.
I look forward to working next year with my colleagues and the Administration to find the necessary resources to keep PTP working for some of California’s most at-risk populations so we can keep them in their homes.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor vetoed her bill to help ensure transit operators are better able to recover costs for nonemergency, medically necessary transportation services.
“Our local and regional transit operators are federally required to provide nonmedical transportation and nonemergency medical transportation to those who need specialized transportation assistance to get to doctor’s appointments, physical therapy, or other medically necessary services. AB 719 would have ensured transit operators were reimbursed for providing these services to Medi-Cal patients from funds already designated for that purpose, in part because a change in the law in 2016 had inadvertently made it harder for these reimbursements to occur. 
I was disappointed to see the Governor veto AB 719 today, but I will continue to work with my colleagues and the Administration on ways we can help public transit operators address long-term financial hurdles, especially when it comes to reimbursement for the services they are already mandated to provide.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor’s Veto of AB 589
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor vetoed her bill to create a pilot project that would ensure housing for LGBTQ+ youth in crisis.
“AB 589 would have established a three-year pilot project to provide affirmative, supportive housing options for LGTBQ+ youth in crisis experiencing rejection by their own families. These ‘Unicorn Homes’ would have served a population of young people who are often more likely to find themselves at risk of homelessness, while at the same time also face greater difficulty finding shelters that accept and respect them. No state housing program targets LGBTQ+ youth at risk of homelessness specifically, and many nonprofit organizations that would help meet this need are struggling. 
While I am disappointed by the Governor’s decision today, I am committed to finding the necessary resources moving forward so these young people will have a safe, affirming place to go when their own family situation is no longer an option.”

Statement by Assemblymember Boerner on Governor Signing AB 1481
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement today after the Governor signed her bill to ensure access to health care for those who are pregnant while they are going through the Medi-Cal application process.
“AB 1481 is a commonsense measure that ensures a pregnant person applying for support through Medi-Cal has access to the vital care they need while that application is processed. It builds on an existing program, Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women, which allows temporary coverage for up to 60 days while the application was processing. Delays in that process past 60 days puts those who are expecting at risk of a lapse in coverage.
AB 1481 prevents against any such lapse by allowing benefits to be extended until that application is complete, and it adapts the name of the program to be more reflective and inclusive of our diverse communities – Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant People. 
I was delighted to have the Governor sign this into law today, because nobody who is expecting should have to worry about whether bureaucratic delays will cause them to lose access to care they need to protect their health and the health of their child.”

SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner issued the following statement today after the California Highway Patrol established an electric bike safety and training program in compliance with Assembly Bill 1946, which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and took effect on January 1, 2023.
“I am excited to see the release of the California Highway Patrol’s e-bike training program. I’m especially grateful for their time and effort spent collaborating with a diverse group of relevant stakeholders. I hope every e-bike rider takes the time to review e-bike safety, emergency maneuver skills, rules of the road, and other laws related to e-bikes.
As our State continues to move towards more sustainable transportation solutions, making it safer for all of those sharing the road is a priority of mine and requires a comprehensive approach. The California Highway Patrol’s promotion and enforcement of safe pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorist behavior, ensures we all share the road safely.”

Taking Action to Reduce High Utility Rates
SACRAMENTO — Last year, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) requested an audit through the Joint Legislative Audit Committee to determine why Californians were paying exorbitant costs for their utilities. The results on how to better regulate utility rates were released this morning.
“The audit has brought to light some critical information we otherwise wouldn’t have had. At its core, we know the California Public Utilities Commission and Cal Advocates need to be required to do a better job advocating for ratepayers by looking at the full picture of a utility’s financials,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “We’ll be pursuing legislation next year to take the recommendations from the State Auditor and make it a reality for every ratepayer to reduce utility costs and protect consumers.”
California’s electricity rates are some of the highest in the country, and one of the main purposes of both the Public Utilities Commission and Cal Advocates is to prevent potential energy rate abuses. The State Legislature will work cohesively with all agencies to promote transparency and strengthen oversight on for-profit entities.
It is crucial the State implements checks and balances when it comes to energy rates and match costs to how much electricity is actually being used, further safeguarding consumers from unsubstantiated rate increases.

Tasha Boerner,Governor Newsom Signs Bill Aiming to Prevent Coastal Cliff Failures,2023-07-21,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) bill to extend the sunset date for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to conduct research on coastal cliff landslides and erosion in the county of San Diego by one year was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom.
“Bluff failures are a constant threat to beachgoers and coastal neighborhoods throughout California,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “AB 72 ensures we have enough time to consider the data-driven outcomes holistically, which is necessary to keep our communities safe in the face of sea-level rise. I’m grateful for the Governor’s signature on this critical legislation.”
In 2021, Assemblymember Boerner’s AB 66 directed Scripps researchers to collect data on bluffs at Beacons Beach in Encinitas and Del Mar. The deadline extension requested in AB 72 is due to significant permitting delays at Beacons Beach, which prevented the timely installation of several key sensors, including a subsurface high-sensitivity strain meter used for detecting small-scale ground movement. “AB 72 can significantly advance research on the dynamics of cliff collapse along California's coastlines,” said Mark Zumberge, a Research Geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “With the Governor granting an extension from AB 72, we aim to gain a better understanding of the processes leading up to cliff failures. Our goal is to learn how deformations are impacted by tides, large surf, groundwater, and rainfall to see if we can answer the question of whether signals exist that can forecast where and when an increased risk for collapse is developing. We thank Assemblymember Tasha Boerner for her commitment to learning if we can create an early warning system and keep our communities safe.”
Without a project extension, full data collection would only cover one full winter when coastal erosion and landslides occur more frequently, limiting the overall project outcomes and recommendations. This is a critical step in creating an early-warning notification system, much like we have for earthquakes.
The research will be completed no later than January 1, 2026 and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will provide the State Legislature a report by the end of March, 2026.

Tasha Boerner,Governor Newsom Signs Bill to Empower Our Aging Population,2023-07-21,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Today, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) bill to keep our elderly population engaged and active in California’s legislative process was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 559 allows people to continue to be able to voluntarily contribute a portion of their tax refund to help the California Senior Legislature advocate for our older communities.
“As we age, we should continue to feel empowered to choose how we live. Sometimes our health and support systems may falter, which is why it is vital we have a voice for our aging population,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “AB 559 provides people with the opportunity to choose, if they’d like, to contribute a portion of their tax refund to promote advocacy from the California Senior Legislature on behalf of our seniors. Thank you Governor Newsom for signing this legislation and helping us take care of our older folks.”
“The California Senior Legislature is the legislative champion for California seniors with over 40 years of advocacy experience. In an environment where seniors are destined to become the largest population segment in the State, it is critical we have an organization with a clear history of supporting them,” said Janice Bailey, Executive Director of the California Senior Legislature and sponsor of the bill. “We are grateful for Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s leadership on AB 559 and for the Governor’s signature on this important legislation.”
AB 559 sailed through policy committees and floor votes with bipartisan, unanimous support because the State Legislature recognizes that after their many years of contributing to our communities, it’s only right we have the option to give back to California seniors.
The Franchise Tax Board will revise the return for taxable years 2017 to 2030 to allow taxpayers to provide contributions.

Statement on Shifting Gears on ‘Stop as Yield’ Bill
SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner issued the following statement today after holding AB 73 in the Senate Transportation Committee.
While AB 73 had broad bipartisan support within the California Legislature, I made the difficult decision to hold it as a two-year bill in order to work in tandem with stakeholders to craft a robust and comprehensive bike and e-bike safety bill package next year.
As our state continues to move towards more sustainable transportation solutions, bicycles and e-bikes are playing a greater role. That also means we need to take a more comprehensive approach to changing the culture around bicycle safety and how bicyclists integrate and interact with motorists, transit, and pedestrians. Whether someone is riding a bike or driving a car, everyone needs to have a mutual understanding of what their responsibilities are when they are on the road. This means more training, public awareness, and better enforcement.

Coming off the biggest surplus in the California Budget, it has been projected that this year, lower revenues are expected and yet, we have the second highest revenues in State history. Negotiations with our partners produced a balanced budget that preserves our core, ongoing programs and while several key spending priorities remain to be worked out, the budget plan sent to the Governor today:
I'm also very pleased to see all of the funding priorities especially focused on increased sustainability, opportunity, and safety in my district:
As a mother and a legislator, I believe that the State Budget is a reflection of our values. It is vital that we prioritize resources to address the climate crisis and focus on transitioning towards clean energy, continue to work towards solving our housing crisis, and ensure healthcare coverage for Californians everywhere. I look forward with optimism to the Governor’s final approval and signature on these bills.

Tasha Boerner,Statement on Raising the Pride Flag in Carlsbad,2023-06-09,press_release,NA,"
CARLSBAD, Calif. — During Pride Month we celebrate that love always wins. All orientations are included and welcomed in California, which is why I joined elected officials and the public to raise the Pride flag on State land. It is important that our LGBTQIA+ family, friends, neighbors, and allies see our commitment to inclusivity, as well as the State’s leadership on supporting our LGBTQIA+ community.
While California has historically been a safe place for the LGBTQIA+ community, our work is not done. I am committed to protecting the rights of LGBTQIA+ Californians in the face of increasing anti-LGBTQIA+ attacks on our community.
I authored AB 589 to promote housing stability and a positive support system for our LGBTQIA+ youth. Stable and affirming housing plays a vital role in the safety of youth identifying as LGBTQIA+. This bill creates the Unicorn Homes Transitional Housing for Homeless LGBTQIA+ Youth Program pilot project to help identify, screen, and train LGBTQIA+ affirming households that host LGBTQIA+ youth experiencing homelessness due to family rejection with a safe place to stay.
Raising the Pride flag is a symbol that we stand as allies to the LGBTQIA+ community and will not tolerate hate and bigotry.

Tasha Boerner,Recognizing The League of Amazing Programmers at the Capitol,2023-06-08,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Today, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner (D-Encinitas) recognized The League of Amazing Programmers at the State Capitol. Each year, California Assemblymembers and State Senators select a nonprofit from their district to be recognized for their work to provide services to those in need, promote social change, and improve the quality of life in their communities.
“It was a privilege to recognize The League of Amazing Programmers for the critical work they are doing in my district to promote equity in our digital age,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner. “Their dedication to helping our youth, especially girls and underrepresented communities, is transforming lives throughout San Diego.”
The League teaches kids and teens how to code through eight different levels that range from beginner to certified programmers. Their mission is to help more youth, including girls and underserved students, acquire the skills and education needed to be leaders and contribute to the workforce of the 21st century. They aim to create a positive impact on all students by helping them develop critical thinking skills and self-confidence through learning computer programming.
“We’ve been around for over fifteen years now, and it’s such an honor to be recognized at the Capitol by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner,” said Sarah Tuakli Cooper, Executive Director of The League of Amazing Programmers. “San Diego is a growing tech hub and it’s really important that we make these incoming opportunities accessible to underserved communities. We want programmers to look like the diversity of San Diego County.” 
The League seeks to address unfilled programming jobs in the United States by getting students interested in coding at a young age, further developing our workforce and economy.

Tasha Boerner,Statement on Water Ratepayers Protection Act of 2023,2023-06-01,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — I introduced AB 530 to provide transparency regarding our fundamental concerns on the lack of a public vote for all those impacted by water district detachments.
When a single governmental reorganization will increase the water rates of nearly every household in San Diego County and have other long-term implications, I believe a vote of all the affected people should be required so that those that would be negatively impacted through higher water rates can have a voice. Given these matters are determined through a state-designated process by local entities that are vested authorities by the state, legislative action is warranted and appropriate.
AB 530 is essential legislation to protect the ratepayers of San Diego, which is why I will be amending its provisions into a bill currently in the Senate where we will proceed through the legislative process.
I have made it a top priority to address rising utility costs throughout the state, as San Diegans deserve accountability and oversight to protect our hard-working families and residents. I look forward to the discussions on this bill in both the Senate and Assembly, and ultimately securing the Governor’s signature.

Tasha Boerner,Unicorn Homes for LGBTQ+ Youth Passes Assembly Floor,2023-05-31,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Today, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) bill to promote housing stability and a positive support system that helps transition LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness to permanent housing either as independent adults, or by reuniting with their family passed the Assembly Floor with a bipartisan 71-0 vote.
“Stable and affirming housing plays a vital role in the safety of all youth, especially youth identifying as LGBTQ+,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “AB 589 creates the Unicorn Homes Transitional Housing for Homeless LGBTQ+ Youth Program pilot project to help identify, screen, and train LGBTQ+ affirming households that host LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness due to family rejection with a safe place to stay.”
“Every LGBTQ Center in California can share stories of abuse and violence, but also youth resilience over the stories of human trafficking and substance use. The Unicorn Homes program was born out of necessity,” said Max Disposti, Founder and Executive Director of the North County LGBTQ Resource Center. “AB 589 helps provide a roof over our youth’s head where they can be supported and when possible, reunified with their family of origin. Unicorn Homes recruits a network of families willing to step in and offer a room at no cost. This program is critical in preventing chronic homelessness.”
AB 589 seeks to address the housing crisis in a unique way. There is no state housing program targeted directly at LBGTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and Unicorn Homes can help support state efforts to prevent and end homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth.
AB 589 now moves to the Senate for their consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Unicorn Homes for LGBTQ+ Youth,2023-04-25,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) bill to promote housing stability and a positive support system that helps transition LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness to permanent housing either as independent adults, or by reuniting with their family passed the Assembly Human Services Committee with a bipartisan 7-0 vote.
“Stable and affirming housing plays a vital role in the safety of all youth, especially youth identifying as LGBTQ+,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “AB 589 creates the Unicorn Homes Transitional Housing for Homeless LGBTQ+ Youth Program pilot project to help identify, screen, and train LGBTQ+ affirming households that host LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness due to family rejection with a safe place to stay.”
People who identify as LGBTQ+ and are experiencing homelessness have greater difficulty finding shelters that accept and respect them, and are often at a greater risk of assault, trauma, and early death. Unicorn Homes is an alternative to the traditional group homeless shelter by placing eligible youth with LGBTQ+ affirming host homes and provides paths to mental health resources, job readiness, life coaching, and independent living skills.
“Low-barrier housing programs are desperately needed to support LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and housing instability. Many LGBTQ+ youth have been disowned by their families or are escaping emotional and physical abuse because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,” said Craig Pulsipher, Legislative Director of Equality California. “Aging out of the foster care system, poverty, and the shortage of shelters and housing programs can also leave many LGBTQ+ youth with nowhere to go. AB 589 will help to support and expand existing programs that provide safe and affirming transitional housing and support services for these vulnerable youth.”
AB 589 seeks to address the housing crisis in a unique way. There is no state housing program targeted directly at LBGTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and Unicorn Homes can help support state efforts to prevent and end homelessness among LGBTQ+ youth.
AB 589 now moves to the Assembly Appropriations Committee for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Ending Ambulance Surprise Billing,2023-04-17,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner’s (D-Encinitas) bill preventing consumers from being charged an out-of-network surprise bill for ground ambulance services passed the Assembly Emergency Management Committee with a bipartisan 6-0 vote. AB 716 protects uninsured Californians from being charged inflated ambulance rates.
“The last thing anyone should be thinking about during a medical emergency is whether they can afford the ambulance ride,” said Assemblymember Boerner. “AB 716 prevents consumers from being hit with those surprise bills for ground ambulance service, protect the uninsured, and help ensure that the costs are better covered for the heroic work of our firefighters and paramedics.”
Too many Californians receive big surprise bills when they call 911 in an emergency and are taken by ambulance to the hospital. A surprise bill happens when a person does the right thing by seeking in-network care but is unknowingly seen by an out-of-network provider for a service. In the case of ambulances, the consumer has no choice whether the ambulance that arrives is contracted with their health plan.
“During a medical emergency, no one should worry if calling 911 will result in a large bill from an ambulance provider. In those stressful situations, Californians should only be focusing on getting the immediate health care they need, not worrying about if they will face medical debt,” said Katie Van Deynze, Policy and Legislative Advocate with Health Access California, the sponsor of the bill. “With AB 716, Californians will have more financial security during and after a medical emergency and will be less hesitant to call 911 out of fear of a large surprise bill.”
AB 716 seeks to protect consumers from potentially destabilizing surprise bills. Recent state and federal laws, including the “No Surprises Act” have banned similar surprise bills from out-of-network doctors, hospitals, emergency rooms, and air ambulances, but ground ambulances remain a glaring gap in these protections. AB 716 now moves to the Assembly Health Committee for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,2023 Woman of the Year,2023-03-21,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) has selected Carol Kim as the 2023 Woman of the Year for Assembly District 77.
Every year during Women’s History Month in March, state legislators select a woman in their district whose contributions to her community deserve to be celebrated and given this honor. Kim, along with 119 other awardees, was honored at today’s California Woman Making Herstory Awards Ceremony.
“My district has countless women contributing so much to our communities every day,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “I am excited to honor Carol because of her work to ensure an equitable future – from serving high-risk groups, LGBTQ+ communities, and communities of color, she is an advocate that works tirelessly for us all.”
Carol is a business manager for San Diego County Building & Construction Trades Council (SDCBCTC) and the CEO of the SDCBCTC Family Housing Corporation. Carol serves on the boards of the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, the San Diego Convention Center, and Run Women Run.
After graduating from UCLA in 1998, Carol began her career as a classroom teacher in an inner city school in Los Angeles. Her years as a teacher were followed by several more working in HIV prevention, where she served high-risk groups including active and recovering substance users, adolescents in the foster care and judicial systems, and underserved communities.
“Thank you to Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath for being a great role model for women and girls in my district,” Kim said. “The reason I was honored today was because of all the amazing work the San Diego County Building & Construction Trades Council does.”
Following a move to San Diego, she carried her experience as a practitioner in the fields of education and public health to work as a Research Associate in the Health & Human Development program for an education research nonprofit, working with schools, school districts, and community colleges both in San Diego County and throughout the state of California. In 2013, she took a leap into politics, and has been an advocate for working families ever since.
After several years serving as the Political Director of SDBCTC and the Director of Community Engagement for the SDBCTC Family Housing Corporation (SDBTC FHC), running electoral campaigns, advocating for legislation, and organizing community coalitions, Carol is now the Business Manager of the SDBCTC and the CEO of the SDBTC Family Housing Corporation.
The Woman of the Year program has a proud 30-year history in the Legislature, dating back to its creation in 1987 by Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R) and Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D). Carol Kim and this year’s Women of Impact awardees will be honored at an event in the district on Saturday, March 25.

Tasha Boerner,Gun Violence is Preventable,2023-03-15,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — In 2023, it seems that every day we hear news of a mass shooting. For years, those of us in the California State Legislature have been calling for federal action to reduce gun violence. Yesterday, President Joe Biden took an important first step with his Executive Order.
The objective of this Executive Order will be to increase background checks prior to firearm sales, moving us closer to universal background checks, increase the effective use of “red flag” laws, and hold the gun industry accountable. It also strengthens law enforcement’s ability to identify and apprehend shooters.
California’s Legislature has done so much to fight gun violence, but we can only prevent tragedy through further national efforts like this.

Tasha Boerner,Bill to Expand Blue Carbon Projects Clears First Hurdle,2023-03-14,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill encouraging more blue carbon projects in coastal lagoons, estuaries, bays, wetlands, and marine habitats cleared its first legislative hurdle, with an 8-0 vote in the Assembly Natural Resources Committee.
Blue Carbon describes carbon naturally stored in coastal and ocean ecosystems like wetlands, which act as “carbon sinks.” Despite occupying less than 5 percent of land area globally and less than 2 percent of the ocean, they store roughly 50 percent of all carbon buried in coastal sediments. Some blue carbon ecosystems can sequester five times more carbon than tropical rainforests and store 50 times more in their surrounding soil.
“We must use every tool at our disposal to combat the climate crisis,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This bill promotes Blue Carbon projects and help them play a direct role in revitalizing California’s nature-based carbon sinks, helping to naturally remove greenhouse gases from the environment.” California has lost over 90 percent of its historical wetlands and the associated benefits they provide, such as protecting coastal communities from some of the harmful impacts of the climate crisis, including sea-level rise and coastal flooding. Most blue carbon habitats in California appear in the form of tidal salt marshes and seagrasses. AB 45 allows the California Coastal Commission to add carbon sequestration to the relevant factors in designing mitigation projects, where feasible. It also allows the Commission to approve new blue carbon mitigation banks, which currently are not available. In order to demonstrate the potential of blue carbon’s removal of greenhouse gases, AB 45 requires data collection on these projects. 
“Thank you, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath, for your leadership on protecting and conserving blue carbon ecosystems,” said Angela Kemsley, Conservation Director at WILDCOAST. “AB 45 will ensure that blue carbon ecosystems are preserved by allowing the California Coastal Commission to require demonstration projects to obtain certain permits and will add to the rapidly growing research in the field of blue carbon by requiring monitoring of permitted projects.” AB 45 now moves to the Assembly Appropriations Committee for their consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Governor Signs Boerner Horvath Bill Establishing Deputy Secretary for Climate,2022-09-16,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill to create the position of Deputy Secretary for Climate was signed by Governor Newsom on Friday. AB 2204 would establish the position within California’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency to coordinate with relevant state agencies and stakeholders to assist with the oversight of California’s transition to a sustainable and equitable carbon neutral economy, especially as it relates to our energy workforce. As the state moves away from fossil fuel toward renewables in support of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, the Deputy Secretary for Climate will help ensure our state has the jobs and the trained workforce necessary to support California’s carbon-neutral energy needs. “To reach our ambitious climate goals, it is imperative that we have an appointed position in state government that can coordinate our transition to a clean energy economy,” Assemblymember Boerner Horvath said. “AB 2204 will create a key position within the Administration tasked with tracking the jobs and ensuring we have the workforce necessary to support our move toward 100% carbon-neutral energy.”
California’s climate leadership has led to unprecedented growth in clean energy industries and jobs — one out of six clean energy jobs in America in 2019 was located in the state. According to a report conducted by the Department of Economics and Political Economy Research Institute, there are about 113,000 people employed in the 14 fossil fuel and ancillary industries in California. A 50% closure of the oil and gas industry from 2021-2030 would result in total job losses of around 57,600 jobs statewide over 10 years.
One of the major hurdles in transitioning existing fossil fuel activities to clean energy ones is anticipating and mitigating the economic impact to workers and communities invested in those industries. Under AB 2204, the Deputy Secretary for Climate is tasked with monitoring and helping coordinate the progress of the state moving toward 100% clean energy. To the extent possible, the person in this position will identify the timing and location of fossil fuel facility closures as well as short-term and long-term workforce transition needs, including projected impacts on workers, businesses, and communities related to workforce development, training, job loss, and job creation.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Bill to Address Lifeguard Shortages at Public Pools Signed by Governor,2022-09-14,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill to address shortages of qualified lifeguards at public pools has been signed by Governor Newsom on Tuesday. AB 1672 will allow ocean lifeguards to provide services at local public swimming pools when there is a demonstrated staffing shortage. Nearly every industry has faced staffing shortages due to the pandemic and municipalities are no exception. Cities, in particular, are experiencing a shortage of lifeguards at city-run swimming pools and aquatic centers. This shortage has resulted in a reduction of hours of operation affecting all the services provided to the community including, aquatic fitness programs, and lifeguard training and certification programs. One barrier in increasing the number of lifeguards on duty at public swimming pools is the certification equivalency for lifeguard training. Under current law, lifeguards are required to either have certification from the American Red Cross, the YMCA, or have equivalent qualifications as determined by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Ocean lifeguards receive their certification by the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) certified agencies. As such, cities are not able to use ocean lifeguards to provide services at city pools. “It’s obvious that ocean lifeguards are trained to a standard that meets or exceeds the duty requirements to keep swimmers at our public pools safe,” Assemblymember Boerner Horvath said. “AB 1672 rectifies a technicality in existing law to allow our cities to effectively address staffing shortages at pools, keeping them safe and open.” AB 1672 allows a local public agency to use ocean lifeguards to maintain required staffing levels and provide lifeguard services at public swimming pools during a staffing shortage. To do so, the public agency must be recognized by USLA as a certified agency and the local legislative body must approve a resolution stating the use of qualified lifeguard personnel is needed for a time period no longer than 12 months in order to maintain regular operating hours of public swimming pools.

Tasha Boerner,Statement on AB 1713,2022-09-02,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Despite overwhelming support from cyclists, active mobility advocates, and my fellow legislators, I made the difficult decision to not bring AB 1713 to a vote in the Senate.

This legislation has evolved significantly since I first introduced it in 2021 to accommodate concerns from various parties, including the Governor. In his veto message for AB 122 last year, Gov. Newsom cited concern for children’s safety and the fear of high accident rates at intersections.

Make no mistake though, stop-as-yield for cyclists will make riding a bike safer. Intersections are where cyclists are most at-risk and there is good reason just 4% of cyclists say they come to a complete stop at intersections. Being forced to come to a full stop means cyclists spend more time regaining speed to match traffic and more time inside intersections, exposing them to greater risk of collisions with autos.

Delaware passed a similar law in 2017 which saw a 23% reduction in crashes involving bicycles at intersections. AB 1713 is intended to incentivize cyclists to ride on side streets and off car-heavy thoroughfares and intersections — where cyclists are often most at-risk — even though these smaller streets typically have more stop signs at shorter intervals.

While we had hoped to find enough agreement to advance this bill this year, we want to take the time to get this right. We will continue to work on this issue with stakeholders and the Governor’s office to help address concerns and find ways to make clear that stop-as-yield will actually make our roads a safer space for bicyclists — a goal we should all be striving for as California works toward a green energy future.

Tasha Boerner,E-Bike Safety Education Bill by Boerner Horvath Signed by Governor,2022-08-16,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill requiring the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to develop statewide safety standards and training programs for e-bike users, has been signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday, Aug. 15.
While the majority of bicyclists follow the rules of the road, cities have seen an increase of pre-teens and teenagers breaking rules and engaging in dangerous behavior, such as not wearing a helmet, obeying traffic safety rules, and piling-on multiple riders onto a single bike. Without statewide safety education and training standards, local authorities are faced with addressing e-bike safety concerns in their communities without direction or tools to educate riders.
“E-bikes’ increased accessibility and speed require proven, statewide safety education and training programs on how to ride safely and legally,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “I’m thrilled Gov. Newsom has signed this important legislation that will keep riders safe across the state as they take up this exciting mode of active transportation.”
The E-Bike Safety and Education Training Program addresses the lack of statewide, uniform, e-bike safety education and training standards by requiring the CHP to develop, by September 1, 2023, safety and training guidelines for e-bike riders in-line with evidence-based practices. CHP will work collaboratively with relevant stakeholders in developing these safety standards and training programs, which will be posted to the department’s website upon completion. E-bikes make it easier to ride than ever before, though it also means less-experienced riders can travel faster with greater ease, increasing the risk of crashes and injuries. One study by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System determined accidents involving e-bikes are more likely to result in serious injuries than traditional bikes with the most common types of injuries including head injuries, broken bones, back and spinal injuries, and cuts and bruises.

Tasha Boerner,Governor Newsom Signs Bill Extending California Work Sharing Program,2022-07-20,press_release,NA,"

Governor Newsom Signs Bill Extending California Work Sharing Program
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill on Tuesday making it easier for California employers to retain their employees and avoid layoffs during economic hardship. During the pandemic and the resulting economic uncertainty, many employers have been faced with the difficult decision of laying off employees in order to stay in business. The California Employment Development Department’s (EDD) Work Sharing program helps keep Californians fully employed while relieving some of the payroll burden of their employers. The program allows for the payment of Work Sharing Unemployment Insurance benefits to employees with reduced wages or work hours, ensuring employees are fully compensated, but allowing employers to make necessary reductions in payroll to weather difficult economic times — while retaining those valued, skilled workers. AB 1854 repeals the January 1, 2024 sunset date for the program’s streamlined, online application process. Since the establishment of the program in 1978, applications were required to be sent by U.S. mail to be processed. This bill effectively makes the new online process permanent and encourages more employers to make use of the vital program. “EDD’s Work Sharing program helps employers keep employees on the payroll and be in a better position to recover once conditions improve,” Assemblymember Boerner Horvath said. “AB 1854 simply ensures that employers can continue to make use of the streamlined online application to retain their talent. Thank you to Governor Newsom for signing this important legislation that helps California workers keep their jobs during tough times.” The new, streamlined online application process was established through another of Boerner Horvath’s bills, AB 1731, which was signed into law in September of 2020. This brought EDD’s Work Sharing program application process into the 21st century, making it easier than ever before for employers to get enrolled quickly and retain skilled employees.

For Immediate Release: Monday, June 27, 2022
Assemblymembers Tasha Boerner Horvath and Brian Maienschein Request Audit of SDG&E Rate Increases
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymembers Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) and Brian Maienschein (D-San Diego), with full bipartisan support, requested a state audit on Monday regarding energy rate increases by San Diego Gas & Electric that were approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
Ratepayers in San Diego pay the highest energy prices in the United States, averaging 36.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Some residents have reported a tripling in energy costs during the first quarter of 2022 alone despite an overall reduction in energy consumption. This comes as Sempra Energy, which owns SDG&E, recorded over $1.25 billion in profits.
“San Diego ratepayers deserve to know why they’re paying the highest energy rates in the country while Sempra Energy shareholders just received their highest-ever dividend in May,” Assemblymember Boerner Horvath said. “This is wrong on its face — like many families, mine has worked hard to reduce our energy use, yet our bill went up by $120 a month. I look forward to the findings and recommendations presented by the State Auditor, which will shed light on the decisions that went into approving increased rates.”

Nearly 356,000 ratepayers — over a quarter of SDG&E’s customers — are behind on paying their energy bills, signaling that San Diego residents are struggling to power their homes.
“Californians are struggling, and SDG&E’s rate increase only adds to the financial distress that so many San Diegans are already facing,” said Assemblymember Maienschein. “This increase was not properly communicated to customers, and many had to scramble to make ends meet in order to pay for a utility as essential as energy. Given that so many families are still coping with the hardships of the ongoing pandemic, this could not be more untimely and inconsiderate to the impact rate payers are feeling. An audit of SDG&E is critical to finding answers and, most importantly, opportunities to immediately lower rates.”
The California State Auditor will determine how major costs, including fire risk mitigation and rising natural gas prices, contribute to the rate increases, how SDG&E financially benefitted from increased rates, and if the CPUC acted adequately to protect ratepayers from spikes and increased energy bills. The result of this investigation will be published by the State Auditor.

Tasha Boerner,Tasha Boerner Horvath Honors Kristine Schindler as 2022 Woman of the Year,2022-03-25,press_release,NA,"CARLSBAD, Calif. — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) has selected Kristine Schindler as the 2022 Woman of the Year for Assembly District 76. Every year during Women’s History Month in March, state legislators select a woman in their district whose contributions to her community deserve to be celebrated and given this honor. Schindler, along with 10 other awardees, will be honored at this year’s Women of Impact Award ceremony on Friday, March 25. “North County is full of amazing women who make our communities better every day,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Kristine stands out for the sheer breadth of activities she is involved in, working tirelessly to make AD76 more bike-friendly, active, and healthier — something very near and dear to my heart.” Schindler has been instrumental in efforts to improve North County’s biking infrastructure, education, and engagement. She’s been involved with half a dozen active mobility advocacy groups, including Circulate San Diego, San Diego County Bicycle Coalition, League of American Bicyclists, and Bike Walk groups for Solana Beach and Encinitas. 

Having worked over 20 years in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, Schindler was involved in the treatment of illness. She quickly realized that prevention was every bit as important as treatment, but rarely received the same amount of attention and funding. “I just saw a lot of time, money, and effort being spent on disease treatment,” Schindler said. “And that kind of planted the seed, thinking, ‘my goodness, we were spending so much on this — we really should be spending more effort on prevention.’” Schindler moved to California in 1997. Now calling North County home, she quickly became involved in several local community organizations, including becoming a docent at Torrey Pines State Reserve, volunteering as a crossing guard for elementary students at a busy Lomas Santa Fe intersection, and for Meals on Wheels. Schindler decided to make a career shift in 2011 to focus on prevention at the crossroads of health, community, and the environment. Schindler credits her friends and mentors for their involvement, helping sustain her passion to improve her community. “The people I’ve met are just fantastic, trying to make the San Diego region and beyond a healthy, connected place to live,” Schindler said. “To be honest, when I saw the list of the other women highlighted this month I thought, ‘whoa, this is a big village to be a part of.’ There are so many dedicated, motivated people trying to do the right thing and help others.”
The Woman of the Year program has a proud 30-year history in the Legislature, dating back to its creation in 1987 by Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R) and Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D). Schindler and this year’s Women of Impact awardees will be honored at an event in the district on Friday, March 25. 
The public is invited to take part in celebrating the 2022 Women of Impact Cohort. RSVPs are encouraged but not required. Those interested in participating can RSVP here.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Assist Senior and Disabled Homeowners Passes First Assembly Committee,2022-03-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s (D-Encinitas) bill to increase fairness for our seniors and those with disabilities passed the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee with bipartisan support on Monday. AB 1707 would establish permanent funding for the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement (PTP) Fund. For decades, the PTP Fund has helped keep seniors and disabled Californians in their homes by allowing those who are over 62 years old, are blind, or disabled, to postpone payment on their property taxes and instead make incremental payments at a low interest rate. AB 1707 will guarantee the fund is replenished annually to maintain a balance of $15 million. “Since 1977, the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Fund has helped keep some of our state’s most vulnerable residents in their own homes,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “My bill would make sure this vital program never runs out of the funding it needs to protect our seniors and disabled Californians.” The PTP Fund is managed by the office of State Controller Betty Yee, the state’s chief fiscal officer and a sponsor of AB 1707. Last year, the state controller’s office connected California homeowners with more than $4.3 million in assistance. Because of the Great Recession, the PTP program was suspended from 2009 to 2016, resulting in no new loans being made and the State Controller’s Office collecting on a dwindling number of old loans to fund it. PTP participants must reapply each year to demonstrate they continue to meet eligibility requirements. “Property Tax Postponement is a critical resource for keeping some of California’s most vulnerable in their homes during challenging economic times,” said Controller Yee. “As we strive to address California’s housing crisis, ensuring a consistent source of funding for this tax relief program is a much-needed step.”
AB 1707 seeks to provide a reliable funding source for the PTP program, ensuring it will continue to meet demand and keep people in their homes. AB 1707 now moves to the Assembly Appropriations Committee for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,"Boerner Horvath, North County Students Discuss Climate Action Live from U.N. Conference",2021-11-06,press_release,NA,"GLASGOW – The California State Assembly Delegation to the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which includes Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath, is in Glasgow, Scotland working to foster dialogue with key national and subnational policymakers, foundations, think tanks, businesses, educators, and other stakeholders engaged in efforts to combat climate change. To help local youth engage with the events of this historic conference on the occasion of Youth and Future Generations Day, Boerner Horvath hosted an exclusive virtual Q&A session with students from throughout the 76th Assembly District. Students had the opportunity to virtually ask questions on climate action and the events in Glasgow and hear the Assemblymember’s perspective from the center of the action.
“Whether they’re making their voices heard here in Scotland, or virtually from around the world, we hear a very clear message from this generation – do something now,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “From local decisions to global commitments, I truly believe it’s the active participation of young people – the ones who stand to benefit the most from a successful outcome – that will provide the push needed for leaders at all levels to make this decade a decade of action.”

Since the early days of the U.N. Convention, every Conference of the Parties has included a Young and Future Generations Day to elevate the role of young people in the policy discussions and multilateral negotiations affecting their future. This year, the day coincided with protests conducted by thousands associated with the Fridays for Future movement started by Swedish teen and climate activist, Greta Thunberg in 2018.

As the Chair of the Select Committee on Sea Level Rise and the California Economy and the Assistant Majority Leader for Policy and Research, Boerner Horvath sees her role as a legislative leader to bolster the state’s contribution to global climate efforts, while helping to engage youth in climate decisions happening at all levels of government.

Tasha Boerner,Local Champions for Animal Welfare Named 2021 Small Business of the Year,2021-10-29,press_release,NA,"ENCINITAS - Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) honored Rancho Coastal Humane Society (RCHS) as the 76th Assembly District’s 2021 Small Business of the Year.

Founded by animal lover Maria K. Lloyd, who purchased the small yellow house that RCHS still operates out of today, the shelter is well-known for its personalized pet adoption process, Friends of County Animal Shelters program (FOCAS), and humane education programs.

“Rancho Coastal Humane Society is a local institution and has done such an amazing job at protecting animals and connecting pets with loving owners. It is an honor to name Rancho Coastal Humane Society as our 76th Assembly District’s 2021 Small Business of the Year,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Not only do they run a nationally recognized Animal Welfare program, but their many programs enrich our lives and community.”

RCHS also runs the RCHS Thrift Shop, proceeds from which directly support the care and shelter of homeless adoptable pets. They are also recognized for services that strengthen the human-animal bond, including the Animal Safehouse Program, the Community Pet Food Bank, Pet-Assisted Therapy and Pet Loss Support programs, Veterinary Care Program for Seniors, and community outreach that provides a “helping paw” to people in crisis. RCHS is recognized nationally as a top rated four-star charity by Charity Navigator, achieving a perfect 100-point overall score, which makes it the only animal shelter in Southern California to receive this distinction. RCHS also has a Platinum Seal of Transparency through GuideStar.

“This recognition serves as a great incentive for our team to continue the lifesaving mission Rancho Coastal started over 61 years ago,” said Judi Sanzo, CEO of RCHS. “It is through the generous support of our donors and community that we can stay true to our pledge that no healthy, treatable animal will ever be euthanized because of the length of stay or a lack of space.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Bill to Keep Californians Safer on the Water Signed into Law,2021-10-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 335 — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath's (D-Encinitas) bill to keep Californians safer on the water — was signed by Governor Newsom. The bill received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Legislature. Specifically, this law allows consumers of boats and marine engines to be notified of manufacturers' safety recalls and warranty verification.
This law builds on common sense exemptions made for other industries to promote boating safety while preserving California consumers' unique privacy protections.
“AB 335 helps Californians keep themselves, their families, and friends safer on the water,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “By allowing this limited sharing of information, consumers who buy products, such as vessels or marine engines, will receive important and timely safety recall and warranty verification information.”
AB 335 provides consumers the certainty they need to feel safer on the water and manufacturers the legal certainty they need to collect and retain consumer information to perform safety recalls, ultimately benefiting consumers. Under AB 335, boat and marine engine manufacturers may only receive and retain specific consumer contact information for the limited and exclusive use of conducting product safety recalls and warranty verification.
“Californians bought $718 million in new boats, engines, and trailers in 2018, and AB 335 ensures we can properly and efficiently notify consumers in the case of a safety recall,” said David Dickerson of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the sponsor of the bill. “Thank you, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath, for your commitment to keeping our communities safe on the water.”
The bill has the support of dozens of recreational boating organizations, manufacturers, and dealers.
The new law will take effect on January 1, 2022.

Tasha Boerner,State Lands Commission Empowered to Meet its Mission Thanks to Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s Bill,2021-10-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1390 — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath's (D-Encinitas) bill to modernize the State Lands Commission's authority over school lands — was signed by Governor Newsom. The bill passed both houses of the Legislature with unanimous, bipartisan support. School lands are the state property used to bolster teachers' retirement funds and reach clean energy goals.
“AB 1390 is a win-win-win in legislation that supports our teachers, protects our environment, and helps us meet our sustainability goals,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We owe it to younger generations to fight the climate crisis. AB 1390 reaffirms our commitment and empowers the State Lands Commission to meet its mission.”
AB 1390 updates the law so the Commission can optimize its landholdings to effectively generate revenues for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), and it better positions the state to work with the federal government to meet our clean energy and sustainability goals. The Commission needs to be able to sell off its noncontiguous, square mile plots in remote desert and forestlands, and use those funds to invest in more productive properties. However, an obsolete cap on land acquisition fee expenditures and other limitations in existing law resulted in the Commission losing out to other investors. AB 1390 removes these constraints and provides the Commission with the flexibility needed to meet its mission and also facilitate the return of ancestral lands to Native American tribes.
“I commend Governor Newsom for signing AB 1390 into law. As Chair of the State Lands Commission, I know this bill will make it easier for the Commission to manage public lands for the benefit of all Californians and to generate revenue to support retired teachers,” said Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis. “Thanks to Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s leadership, California will be better positioned to reach our renewable energy and sustainability goals.”
The new law will take effect on January 1, 2022.

Tasha Boerner,Statement from Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath on the Governor’s Veto of AB 122,2021-10-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) released the following statement today regarding Governor Gavin Newsom’s veto of AB 122:
“I was disappointed to see the Governor reject this proposal that has already proven effective at increasing safety for bicyclists in other states. This bill was specifically designed to address the very safety concerns the Governor cited as the reason for his veto. By allowing bicyclists the option of safely yielding at stop sign-controlled intersections, it reduced the amount of time they spent crossing the intersection — the very reason they are exposed to more risk under current law.
I remain committed to advancing this policy, and will continue to monitor its effectiveness in the 10 other states who already have made it law. While I welcome the Governor’s commitment to put more resources towards active transportation projects to expand our accessible bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure for the future, this policy presents a viable option that would improve bicycle safety and start saving lives today using our existing network.”

Tasha Boerner,Statement from Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath on the Governor’s Veto of AB 1215,2021-10-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) released the following statement today regarding Governor Gavin Newsom’s veto of AB 1215:
“Our University of California is one of the most prestigious public university systems in the world. It will only be able to maintain that reputation if its admission processes are above reproach and not subject to manipulation by the wealthy and well-connected. That is why I was discouraged to see the veto of AB 1215 by the Governor, a bill that requested the UC implement common-sense protocols to address some of the most egregious abuses that came to light during the Varsity Blues scandal.
While I recognize the UC has already implemented some measures to address the problems identified during the scandal as well as subsequent audits, this legislation would have placed no greater strictures on them than those recommended by our independent California State Auditor — as the result of an audit my office initiated. In fact, the limited reform measures implemented by the UC the Governor cited in his veto message would have never happened in the first place were it not for the Varsity Blues investigation and the audits that followed. I will continue to work with all my colleagues to hold the UC accountable and ensure every California student, no matter their connections or financial status, has the same opportunity to access this outstanding institution of higher learning.”

Tasha Boerner,Bill to Save Lives and Initiate Development of Bluff Collapse Early Warning System by Boerner Horvath Signed into Law,2021-10-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 66, by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas), was signed by Governor Newsom. This legislation tasks the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego with conducting a research study to improve coastal monitoring capabilities and observations necessary for the state to develop a coastal bluff collapse early warning system to improve beach safety and prevent future fatalities.
AB 66 moved through the Legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support and is an essential first step in developing an early warning system, similar to what we have for earthquakes, that can alert beachgoers, municipalities, and emergency services personnel to the threat of an imminent bluff collapse. The research will focus on the Del Mar Bluffs as well as Beacon’s Beach — an active landslide area in Encinitas.
""With the passage of AB 66, we are one step closer to saving lives along California's coasts,"" said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. ""Bluff collapses are a constant threat to coastal neighborhoods in Northern San Diego County and across the California coast, presenting the risk of fatalities, injuries, and millions of dollars in damage to vital infrastructure.""
Bluff collapses happen more often than not along California's coastline and are a threat anywhere waves, stormwater, and rainstorms can destabilize coastal terrain.
In addition to public safety concerns, eroding cliffs threaten extensive cliff-top development throughout the state, including highways, railways, waste-water, oil, natural gas, nuclear facilities, universities, several critical military bases, and numerous state beaches and parks. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates up to 1,000,000 residents and $320 billion in property throughout California are at risk due to erosion and flooding.
""Thank you, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath, for supporting research to improve our understanding of cliff erosion and prioritizing public safety,"" said Mark Zumberge, a research geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. ""Our goal is to learn how deformations are impacted by tides, large surf, groundwater, and rainfall to see if we can answer the question of whether signals exist that can forecast where and when an increased risk for collapse is developing.""
The new law will take effect on January 1, 2022.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Improve School Lands Management Passes Legislature,2021-09-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1390, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath's bill to modernize the State Lands Commission's authority over school lands, the state property used to bolster teachers' retirement funds and reach clean energy goals, passed the Assembly. The bill has received unanimous, bipartisan support in the State Assembly and Senate, with 72 - 0 and 38 - 0 votes in each house, respectively.
Antiquated restrictions governing the Commission's management of school lands prevent it from effectively generating revenues for California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and partnering with the federal government on renewable energy projects — two critical directives from the Legislature. AB 1390 updates the law so the Commission can optimize its landholdings to meet both end goals.
""It's not often you have a chance to support our public school teachers and protect the environment at the same time, but that's exactly what AB 1390 does,"" said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. ""This bill will also help the State Lands Commission maximize its revenue generation, and I'm glad to see it move forward with such significant bipartisan support.""
To maximize revenue from existing state landholdings, the Commission needs to be able to sell off its noncontiguous, square mile plots in remote desert and forestlands, and use those funds to invest in more productive properties. However, an obsolete cap on land acquisition fee expenditures and other limitations in existing law often result in the Commission losing out to other investors. AB 1390 removes these constraints and provides the Commission the flexibility needed to meet its mission.
""As Chair of the State Lands Commission, I commend the Legislature for approving AB 1390. This bill will make it easier for the State Lands Commission to manage public lands for the benefit of all Californians and generate revenue to support retired teachers,"" said Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis."" AB 1390 will also better position the Commission to work with the federal government on renewable energy and land conservation projects.""
So we may reach our stated goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by half before the end of the decade, the Biden Administration will seek to work with states on leasing land in areas suitable for solar and wind projects. AB 1390 makes California a more flexible partner in this process so our state can work productively with federal agencies toward common 2030 climate goals.
AB 1390 is now headed to the Governor's desk, for his signature.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Restore Fairness to UC Admissions Passes Senate,2021-09-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1215, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill, which responds to incidents of bought-and-paid-for acceptances by installing a strict firewall between admissions and philanthropy staff, passed the Senate on a 38 – 0 bipartisan vote.
The bill also requires the verification of an applicant’s participation in a sport before and after their arrival on campus — a direct response to some of the more extreme tactics used by wealthy parents to jump the line in UC admissions.
“These changes will help restore integrity to the UC system’s admission process,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Public service is central to the mission of the University of California, and when it fails to honor the principles of fairness in favor of connections and wealth, it fails its mission.” 
In May of 2019, while the news of the FBI’s Varsity Blues investigation was breaking, implicating several UC campuses, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath requested a state-level audit of the system’s admissions practices. After the State Auditor’s Office released a report detailing the inappropriate admissions of 64 wealthy applicants and a lack of consistent decision criteria, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath and Assemblymember Kevin McCarthy introduced AB 1215 as joint-authors to capture the Auditor’s key recommendations as they pertain to college athletics.
“For every student admitted through bribery, there is an honest and talented student rejected,” said Assemblymember Kevin McCarty. “Whether a UC campus admits 1 student by fraud, or 100, it is wrong, and it denies admission to honest, qualified students who have worked hard to earn their place at the UC.”
While the Office of the President has started implementing reforms in line with its own audit, the State Auditor’s report makes clear that the internal recommendations did not address significant aspects of the UC admissions process – namely the inadequate training and lack of monitoring of application reviewers. The audit also finds that the Office of the President lacks a minimum set of protocols and procedures to guard against improper decisions and has failed to monitor the admissions practices at all nine UC undergraduate campuses.
AB 1215 now awaits the Governor's signature, and if signed, will become law next year.

Tasha Boerner,"Boerner Horvath's Bill to Promote Safe, Efficient Biking Passes Legislature",2021-09-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 122, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill to make our streets safer for all road users passed the Assembly on a 50 – 17 bipartisan vote, after passing the Senate earlier this week on a 31 – 5 bipartisan vote. Specifically, this law would allow cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign, when safe to do so. This policy has been successfully implemented in nine other states and has proven to reduce collisions, while improving cyclists’ mobility everywhere it was enacted. AB 122 is a six-year pilot, with a detailed report to the legislature after the six years. 
“We must encourage smarter, safer, more efficient transportation options that help people choose to get out of their cars. This cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “AB 122 encourages safe riding in our state by allowing cyclists to spend less time in dangerous intersections.” 
Research and common sense make clear that complete stops at all stop sign-controlled intersections make bike trips slower and require more energy from the rider. Studies on cyclists’ stopping behavior also find that these full stops do nothing to improve, and can even reduce, rider safety — attributed mainly to the increased time cyclists spend in the intersection after a full stop compared to the safe yielding alternative.
According to data collected by the Delaware State Police, crashes involving bicycles at stop-sign controlled intersections fell by 23 percent in the 30 months after the state made the change, contributing to an 11 percent overall decrease in bicycle-involved crashes. Other states that have implemented this change noticed similar trends, and none reported an increase in riding collisions, so much so that the Delaware Senate voted unanimously to make Delaware’s safe yielding law permanent earlier this June. 
Data from multiple major cities in California and elsewhere show that African American and Latino cyclists are disproportionately stopped and fined for moving violations — discouraging ridership in communities that stand to benefit from the air quality benefits that cycling offers.
“Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s policy approach makes San Diego County, and California, safer for all residents,” said Andy Hanshaw, Executive Director of the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition, a supporter of the bill. “This reasonable practice of treating stop signs as yield signs will make intersections much safer for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists, while reducing carbon emissions and encouraging bicycling.” 
AB 122 is supported by a statewide coalition of thousands of cyclists, climate, environmental justice, and public health advocacy organizations. 
AB 122 now moves onto the Governor’s desk for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Initiate Development of Bluff Collapse Early Warning System Passes Senate,2021-09-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 66, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to initiate the development of an early warning notification system for California’s coastal bluff collapses, passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.
With fatalities, injuries, and millions of dollars in property damage just in the last few years, bluff collapses are a constant threat to beachgoers and coastal neighborhoods throughout California. AB 66 would task the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego with expanding the science of coastal erosion with the goal of identifying key indicators for when a bluff is likely to fail.
“When we can save lives up and down the state and also prepare for the challenge presented by climate change and rising seas, we must take action,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We need experts, science, and study to help us predict the day-to-day hazards along our coast. This bill is a necessary first step toward saving lives.”
In August of 2019, Anne Clave, Julie Davis, and Elizabeth Cox tragically passed away after a 30-by-25 heavy sandstone chunk broke loose and fell onto the three women who were sunbathing at Grandview Beach in Encinitas. In February of that same year, a San Francisco woman was fatally trapped after a similar collapse occurred at Fort Funston, burying her under tons of dirt.
“This bill can significantly advance research on the dynamics of cliff collapse along California's coastlines,” said Mark Zumberge, a research geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. “With funding from this bill, we would aim to gain a better understanding of the processes leading up to cliff failures. Our goal is to learn how deformations are impacted by tides, large surf, groundwater, and rainfall to see if we can answer the question of whether signals exist that can forecast where and when an increased risk for collapse is developing.”
While the problem exists throughout the state, the threat is especially acute in coastal North San Diego County, where actively eroding bluffs cover approximately 80% of the coastline. The collapses are becoming increasingly common with the impacts of rising seas, with scientists forecasting erosion at more than twice the historical rate by 2100. A late-April incident at San Elijo State Beach in Cardiff-by-the-Sea led authorities to issue warnings for beachgoers, and an early-March collapse in Del Mar put the economically critical LOSSAN rail line once again in jeopardy of being severed.
“I am grateful for Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s leadership on AB 66 to make North County safe for all to enjoy our coasts,” said Dwight Worden, Deputy Mayor of the City of Del Mar. “The City of Del Mar is home to the Del Mar Bluffs, which have already been identified as a vulnerable coastal sea cliff. As beaches narrow due to sand loss and sea level rise, and as beach attendance continues to increase, beachgoers must continually compete for less and less space, often close to the unstable bluffs. Having the research available for the development of an early warning system will help save lives and protect critical infrastructure at risk.” 
The bill now moves back to the Assembly for concurrence.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Starter Home Revitalization Act of 2021 Signed by Governor Newsom,2021-09-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 803, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath's Starter Home Revitalization Act of 2021, was signed by Governor Newsom. It passed the California State Assembly and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
Homeownership status remains the predominant driver of family wealth – and by extension – a family's potential for upward mobility and community resilience. California's housing affordability crisis continues to hold hard-working families back from the dream of homeownership, with only 27 percent of households in California able to afford a middle-market home.
By facilitating the development of smaller, affordable-by-design, single-family homes on mid-range density multi-family lots, AB 803 will boost supply, while retaining the community character of the surrounding neighborhoods. 
""Californians, and residents of my district, deserve the chance to achieve the American Dream of homeownership, and Governor Newsom's signature brings that dream one step closer to reality,"" said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. ""Young families deserve a shot at buying a house in the place they call home.""
""We are one step closer to making housing affordability a reality for middle-income families and first-time homebuyers thanks to Assemblymember Boerner Horvath,"" said Brett Farrow, an architect, and supporter of the bill. ""Small lot homes provide a sensible housing option, which help us move away from sprawl development, while retaining the character of our communities.""
AB 803 creates new opportunities for residential infill that are more compatible with surrounding single-family neighborhoods, while simultaneously increasing housing diversity – especially important for high-land-value, suburban cities. AB 803 does not increase the existing density or base zoning for any project. 
AB 803 will become law on January 1, 2022.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Comments on Education Budget Bill Headed for Governor's Desk,2021-07-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath issued the following statement after passage of the Legislature’s education budget trailer bill, SB 130.
“The investments made in this bill build on the lessons of the pandemic to ensure school communities can bounce back stronger from the challenges of the past year. Any mother or PTA leader like myself know schools do a lot more than just educate, and this pandemic has made that abundantly clear. Working families, and by extension, our economy, depend on nutritional and after-school services that keep kids healthy, growing, and engaged — even after the final bell. I have always maintained that our approach needs to consider the whole spectrum of a child’s mental and emotional needs, and this year has laid bare what’s at stake for their development if they’re missing out on key mental health supports and targeted interventions.
This budget bill reflects these values with historic investments in our children and communities, including:
While there is still plenty of work to do to make sure this vision for post-pandemic education is realized, I'm encouraged by the priorities reflected in this bill, and I look forward with optimism to the Governor's signature.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Sexual Assault Victims’ Social Media Privacy Bill Signed by Governor,2021-06-29,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — AB 341, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen a sexual assault victim’s right to privacy by applying the same rules of evidence for social media as other forms of evidence, was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom.
Increasingly in sexual assault cases, decades of social media activity irrelevant to the details of the case is being mined and admitted into evidence, often with the result of embarrassing, shaming, or humiliating a victim to the point of discouraging their testimony. AB 341 simply requires that social media content go through the same process as other types of evidence covered under existing Rape Shield Laws.
“In a world shaped by the constantly evolving realities of online life, we need to make sure our judicial system is keeping up,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We know that in many sexual assault cases, the defense is digging through the victim’s social media history, just like evidence regarding character, morality, and sexual history were used before our state’s Rape Shield Laws. It’s time for judges to screen social media evidence in the same way to ensure that victims feel safe to come forward, and I’m glad to see this bill signed into law by the Governor.”
Since its passage in 1974, the California Rape Shield Law has been repeatedly amended to account for evolving technology and other factors impacting the types of material and information being submitted in sexual assault cases that require the defense to prove relevancy before being admitted as evidence. AB 341 still allows the defense to admit social media material – it simply expands the Rape Shield Law to require that the defense must file the same sort of written motion for a court ruling on relevancy if the content does not contain a statement, image, video, or picture of the alleged offense.
“In 2021, in light of expanding digital socialization, it’s become apparent that the original Rape Shield Law original protections are no longer sufficient,” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the sponsor of the bill. “This change to the law provides the updates necessary to continue to protect survivors of sexual assault in the face of these new sorts of tactics, bringing us closer to a world in which they can feel safe enough to testify against their perpetrator and seek justice. I’m pleased to see it signed and thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for her attention to this important issue.”
“Historically, victims of sexual assault endured even more trauma when dealing with the criminal justice system,” said Nina Salarno Besselman, President of Crime Victims United, a co-sponsor of the bill. “Current law protects sexual assault victims from being discredited due to their sexual history and provides for procedural protections before evidence can be brought into trial. As technology has expanded, so has the need to expand these protections, and AB 341 responds to that need. This new law will truly help victims of sexual assault have the courage to report and testify to protect our communities, and on behalf of crime victims, we thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for sponsoring this bill.”
“Sexual assault survivors need the admissibility screening procedures included in AB 341 as a course of action to ensure that they can testify openly against their perpetrator without shame or embarrassment,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, a supporter of the bill. “This update to our Rape Shield Laws will help our system respond to the growth of social media and protect the victim’s dignity, and for that reason, PORAC is pleased to see it signed.”
AB 341 is supported by District Attorneys throughout the state and a variety of victims’ advocacy organizations. It will become law on January 1st, 2022.

Tasha Boerner,Community Resource Center Selected as 2021 Nonprofit of the Year for Assembly District 76,2021-06-25,press_release,NA,"ENCINITAS — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath honors the Encinitas-based Community Resource Center as the 2021 California Nonprofit of the Year for Assembly District 76.
Each year, California Assemblymembers and State Senators select a nonprofit from their district to be recognized for their work to provide services to those in need, promote social change, and improve the quality of life in their communities.
The CRC was selected because of the staff’s tireless work to feed those in need, provide safety to those experiencing homelessness, and enable North County residents in crisis to find refuge and peace of mind.
 “From domestic violence, to homelessness and hunger, all of the problems the CRC’s programs are designed to address were only exacerbated as a result of the pandemic,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Through the hard work and dedication of their staff, and an outpouring of new volunteers, the CRC has been able to keep up their support for the most vulnerable, and then some. CRC’s programs have made all the difference for folks in a tough place, and for that, they deserve to be recognized.”
Founded in 1979 by a group of community and business leaders intent on addressing critical homelessness and food insecurity in the region, the Community Resource Center has grown to offer an extensive set of programs, offering everything from counseling to domestic violence case management and legal advice. Despite the challenges of nonprofit work during the pandemic, the staff and volunteers responded to the crisis with a 30% increase in food distributions, a 38% increase in case management, and a 28% increase in calls answered through their domestic violence hotline.
“The global pandemic and need to address systemic racial justice issues had a distinct impact on people experiencing food insecurity, homelessness and relationship violence,” said Jon Van Cleef, Chief Executive Officer of the Community Resource Center. “CRC was able to respond to these needs because of the dedicated direct-service staff and volunteers, who consistently showed up to provide these essential services, the donors who responded with generosity, and the civic leaders who acted boldly to help their most vulnerable community members.”
This is the sixth year of the California Nonprofit of the Year initiative. In this year of extreme uncertainty and suffering, nonprofits have continued to step up to support our communities as circumstances and needs change swiftly. 
 “Nonprofits are a community of stubborn optimists,” explains Jan Masaoka, CEO of the California Association of Nonprofits (Cal Nonprofits). “Our belief that the world can be better – more equitable, more kind – is powerful. Honoring a California Nonprofit of the Year shows that elected officials recognize and celebrate the good work they see nonprofits doing in their districts.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Commemorates 49th Anniversary of Title IX,2021-06-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — To commemorate the occasion of the 49th Anniversary of the passage of federal Title IX protections, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s AJR 14 passed the Assembly with a unanimous vote.
Before 1972, when Congress first passed the law, women and girls were routinely discriminated against at educational institutions and often denied access to athletics and extracurricular programming comparable to those enjoyed by their male counterparts. By conditioning federal funding on an institution’s commitment to ensuring equal treatment in recruitment, admissions, counseling, financial assistance, discipline, employment, and athletics, Title IX incentivizes institutions to balance their offerings and promote equal opportunity with respect to gender.
“We still have work to do to achieve full gender parity for young students and athletes, but Title IX created a major push in the right direction, opening opportunities for countless women and girls to learn and achieve,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “As the mother of a ten-year-old daughter, it’s important to me that she grow up with all the same opportunities as her thirteen-year-old brother, and that’s what this law is all about. California has been a leader on gender equality, and it’s important we remain committed to that in the future.”
While the law protects people of all gender identities from various forms of sex discrimination, Title IX is closely associated with young women’s athletics, and for good reason – since the law passed, high school girl’s participation in sports has increased more than 1000%. The law’s impact in collegiate athletics can be tied to the success of professional teams as well, notably, the top-ranked U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team, which is comprised almost entirely of former collegiate athletes.
This annual celebration of all that Title IX has accomplished comes at a time when seven California colleges and universities are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for their handling of sexual violence cases – underscoring inequalities that still exist nearly a half-century later and the need to continue the advancements Title IX inspired. 
AJR 14 acknowledges the work that remains and urges Californians to come together to achieve the goal of full gender equality in education and sports.

This bill provides the updates necessary to continue to protect survivors of sexual assault who must now endure attempts to reach into their social media accounts to unfairly attack their credibility in court.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Restore Fairness to UC Admissions Passes Assembly,2021-06-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 233, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to reform UC Admissions practices to restore fairness and prevent influence by the wealthy and well-connected, passed the Assembly on a bipartisan 70-1 vote.
In May of 2019, while the news of the FBI’s Varsity Blues investigation was breaking, implicating several UC campuses, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath requested a state-level audit of the system’s admissions practices. After the State Auditor’s Office released a report detailing the inappropriate admissions of 64 wealthy applicants and a lack of consistent decision criteria, Boerner Horvath introduced AB 233 and its companion, AB 1215, which together capture the Auditor’s key recommendations.
“We have to ensure that admissions protocols at our UC schools honor the principals of fairness that we all believe in,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “When you work hard and perform, you should be able to get ahead — no matter who you know or how wealthy your parents are. These changes will help restore these values to the UC system, and I’m glad to see this bill move forward with such strong bipartisan support.”
In response to the report’s findings on systemic weaknesses in application review, AB 233 requests that the UC Office of the President implement new policies on consistent and unbiased decision-making, with reviewer trainings to ensure these new criteria are being used. The Office must report annually on how each campus is implementing these procedures and current actions to prevent inappropriate interaction between admissions staff and other university departments.
“First-generation college students like myself and the students I represent understand the emotional and financial pressures of preparing, applying, and paying for our education,” said Alan Calderon, undergraduate student and External Vice President at UC Irvine. “If the UC’s commitment to equity in admissions is true, there should be no hesitation when it comes to making the process as strong and transparent as possible. AB 233 reforms are crucial to maintaining the prestige of the UC system, and we as students hope to see the UC follow through."" 
AB 233’s companion, AB 1215, responds to incidents of bought-and-paid-for acceptances by installing a strict firewall between admissions and philanthropy staff. The bill, which will be heard by the full Assembly later this week, requires the verification of an applicant’s participation in a sport before and after they arrive on campus — a direct response to some of the more extreme tactics used by wealthy parents to forge the legitimacy of their child’s admission.
While Office of the President has begun implementing reforms in line with its own audit, the State Auditor’s report makes clear that the internal recommendations did not address significant aspects of the UC admissions process – namely the inadequate training and lack of monitoring of application reviewers. The audit also finds that Office of the President lacks a minimum set of protocols and procedures to guard against improper decisions and has failed to monitor the admissions practices at all nine UC undergraduate campuses.
AB 233 now moves on to the State Senate for their consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Incentivize Electric Bicycle Purchases Passes Assembly,2021-06-02,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 117, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill establishing an electric bicycle purchase incentive program to help people switch to sustainable commuting options, passed the Assembly on a 67-1 bipartisan vote.
Despite their ability to reduce car trips and promote healthy living, e-bikes remain unaffordable for most Californians. A good quality e-bike can cost upwards of $1,200. The cost prevents many lower income Californians from switching to this low-maintenance, zero-emission alternative for short trips.
“If California is serious about tackling climate change, promoting e-bikes needs to be front and center,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “E-bikes help us cut out shorter car trips, reduce emissions, and move us closer to our ambitious climate goals. Now is the time to make e-bikes affordable for all Californians, and I’m pleased to see this bill move forward with such significant bipartisan support.”
A recent study published in the Journal of Transportation Research found that subsidizing electric bikes is a more cost-effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars than electric vehicle incentive programs, which are currently the state’s electric investment focus. By following commuter habits, researchers found that if 15 percent of total commuter miles traveled were by e-bike, a 12 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation could be achieved.
“Compared to EVs, e-bikes are carbon crushers,” said Dave Snyder, Executive Director of the California Bicycle Coalition, the sponsor of the bill. “If California’s climate investments are supposed to prioritize solutions that have additional benefits, then this is a no-brainer. By incentivizing e-bike uptake through AB 117, we can make a serious dent in emissions, while reducing traffic congestion and helping people live healthier, happier lives.”
According to the California Household Travel Survey, more than fifteen percent of vehicle trips in the state are less than one mile, and eighty percent are less than ten. As e-bikes have gained in popularity, evidence shows commuting is a dominant reason people make the purchase. A recent survey of North American e-bike owners found that nearly half (46 percent) of e-bike trips replace car commutes, at an average of 9.3 miles per trip.
""Increasing the number of trips Californians make by bicycle is essential to reducing vehicle miles traveled and achieving our greenhouse gas reduction goals,” said Bill Nesper, Executive Director of the League of American Bicyclists, a supporter of the bill. “To make full use of electric bicycles in this effort, California needs to provide financial assistance to help make them more accessible for low and middle-income people. The League supports the objectives of AB 117 and thanks Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for bringing this important legislation forward.”
AB 117 enjoys support from dozens of community-based organizations throughout the state. It now moves on to the State Senate for their consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Improve School Lands Management Passes Assembly,2021-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1390, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to modernize State Lands Commission authority over “school lands”, state property used to bolster teachers’ retirement funds and reach clean energy goals, passed the Assembly on a unanimous, bipartisan vote.
 
Antiquated restrictions governing the Commission’s management of school lands prevent it from effectively generating revenues for California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) and partnering with the federal government on renewable energy projects — two key directives from the Legislature. AB 1390 updates the law so the Commission can optimize its land holdings for revenue generation and meet both goals.
 
“Today’s teachers will be tomorrow’s retired teachers, and we must ensure we’re providing them with the financial security they deserve,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We also owe it to our children to fight climate change, and that means doing everything we can to reach our ambitious clean energy goals. This bill will help us make good on both of those promises, and I’m glad to see it move forward with such significant bipartisan support.”
 
To maximize revenue from existing state land holdings, the Commission needs to be able to sell off its noncontiguous, square mile plots in remote desert and forest lands, and use those funds to invest in more productive properties. However, an obsolete cap on land acquisition fee expenditures and other limitations in existing law often result in the Commission losing out to other investors. AB 1390 removes these constraints and provides the Commission the flexibility it needs to meet its mission.
 
“As part of its duty to the people of California, the Commission is tasked with investing the School Land Bank Fund revenue in new properties to generate additional revenue for the Teachers’ Retirement Fund, but has been unable to do so optimally because of statutory constraints.” said Jennifer Lucchesi, Executive Officer for the California State Lands Commission. “AB 1390 will put the Commission on a level playing field with other participants in the real estate market, resulting in more lucrative investments and more security for California’s retired educators.”
In an effort to reach its stated goal to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade, the Biden Administration will seek to work with states on leasing land in areas suitable for solar and wind projects. AB 1390 makes California a more flexible partner in this process so the state can work productively with federal agencies toward common 2030 climate goals.
The bill now moves on to the Senate for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Starter Home Revitalization Act of 2021 Passes Assembly,2021-05-20,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 803, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s Starter Home Revitalization Act of 2021, passed the Assembly on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. 
Homeownership status remains the predominant driver of family wealth – and by extension – a family’s potential for upward mobility. California’s housing affordability crisis continues to hold hard-working families back from the dream of homeownership, with only 27 percent of households in California able to afford a middle-market home, as compared to 55 percent nationwide. 
By facilitating the development of smaller, affordable-by-design, single-family homes on mid-range density multi-family lots, AB 803 will boost supply, while retaining community character. 
“We can all agree that California urgently needs to address the housing crisis, and central to achieving that goal should be creative solutions like this one,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “By creating an alternative to McMansions, luxury condos and high-rise apartments, we can fill the “missing middle” in our housing supply with starter homes so young families have a shot at living in the place they call home.” 
“Small lot homes are exactly what is needed for middle income families and first-time homebuyers,” said Brett Farrow, an architect and supporter of the bill. “They’ll also provide a sensible option for people who wish to downsize from larger suburban homes, freeing up more existing housing for new families. Because they’ll mostly be in existing developed areas, these homes will help us move away from sprawl development and the sorts of long commutes that drive greenhouse gas emissions.” 
AB 803 eliminates minimum lot sizes and creates new opportunities for residential infill that are more compatible with surrounding single-family neighborhoods, while simultaneously increasing the housing diversity – especially important for high-land-value, suburban cities. AB 803 does not increase the existing density or or base zoning for any project. 
The bill now moves on to the Senate for consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Enhance Boat Safety Passes Assembly,2021-05-03,press_release,NA,"

SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 335, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to keep boat owners and renters safer by allowing manufacturers to contact buyers in case of a safety recall, passed the Assembly on a bipartisan 74-1 vote. 
In 2018, the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act passed, followed by the overwhelming passage of Proposition 24 in 2020, giving California consumers some of the highest privacy protections in the US. AB 335 extends the 2019 exemptions for road vehicles to watercraft and boat dealers, ensuring that consumers can receive necessary warranty and recall information to keep themselves and their families safer while on the water. 
“California offers the best privacy protections of any state in the country,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We also have more recreational boating than just about any other state, and it’s important that folks are safe while enjoying time out on the water. AB 335 ensures that consumers can be informed of recall or warranty information, and in so doing retains our robust privacy protections, while simultaneously ensuring boating safety. I’m proud to see it move forward with such overwhelming support.” 
""California is the third largest boating state, and Californians bought $718 million in new boats, engines and trailers in 2018,” said David Dickerson of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the sponsor of the bill. “Most certainly the manufacturers of those vessels should be able to verify warranties and contact owners in the event of a safety recall. By allowing this limited sharing and retention of information, the legislature will ensure that consumers receive important and timely safety recall information and can easily confirm warranty eligibility.” 
“Boaters as Californians value the privacy of their personal information that is protected by state law,” said Winston Bumpus, President of the Recreational Boaters of California, a supporter of the bill. “At the same time, boaters are interested in having relevant information about their vessels and expect that the manufacturers of their vessels should be able to verify warranties and contact owners in the event of a safety recall. AB 335 will help ensure that this information is received, and that warranty eligibility can easily be confirmed” 
AB 335 builds on common sense exemptions made for the auto industry to promote boating safety, while preserving the unique privacy protections California consumers enjoy. It has the support of dozens of manufacturers, dealers, and recreational boating organizations. 
The bill now moves to the Senate for their consideration.

SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1390, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to modernize State Lands Commission authority over “school lands”, state property used to bolster teachers’ retirement funds and reach clean energy goals, passed the Assembly Natural Resources Committee on a 10-0 unanimous bipartisan vote.

Antiquated restrictions governing the Commission’s management of school lands prevent it from effectively generating revenues for California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) and partnering with the federal government on renewable energy projects — two key directives from the Legislature. AB 1390 updates the law so the Commission can optimize its land holdings for revenue generation and meet both goals.

“Whether we are talking about the financial security of our retired public school teachers or leaving this world to our children better than we found it, promises made need to be promises kept,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “By empowering the Commission to better manage its resources, we can more effectively use these lands to keep our commitments to hard-working educators and moving our state closer to meeting our 2030 climate goals.”
To maximize revenue from existing state land holdings, the Commission needs to be able to sell off its noncontiguous, square mile plots in remote desert and forest lands, and use those funds to invest in more productive properties. However, an obsolete cap on land acquisition fee expenditures and other limitations in existing law often result in the Commission losing out to other investors. AB 1390 removes these constraints and provides the Commission the flexibility it needs to meet its mission.

“The Commission advances the best interests of the state through effective stewardship of the lands and resources entrusted to its care,” said Jennifer Lucchesi, Executive Officer of the California State Lands Commission, the sponsor of the bill. “Outdated laws are undermining the Commission’s competitiveness as a land buyer, causing it to lose out on key opportunities. By modernizing the laws defining the Commission’s role, AB 1390 will clear the way for the sorts of investments needed to secure a brighter, more sustainable future for all Californians.”

As part of its recently announced goal to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade, the Biden Administration will seek to work with states on leasing land in areas suitable for solar and wind projects.

Tasha Boerner,"Boerner Horvath's Bill to Promote Safe, Efficient Biking Passes Assembly",2021-04-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 122, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill to allow bicycle riders to treat a stop sign as a yield sign, when safe to do so, passed the Assembly on a 53-11 bipartisan vote. This policy, which has been successfully implemented in six states, is proven to reduce collisions while improving riders’ mobility.

“To cut down on car emissions, promote healthy living, and improve equity, we need neighborhoods that encourage safe bicycle riding,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We know from the example of other states that when riders are allowed to yield at stop signs, they choose safer streets and will spend less time in dangerous intersections. It’s time for California to live up to its values and start encouraging — not penalizing — smart riding in our state.”

Research and common sense make clear that complete stops at all stop sign-controlled intersections make bike trips slower and require more energy from the rider. Studies on bicyclists’ stopping behavior also find that these full stops do nothing to improve, and can even reduce, rider safety - attributed largely to the increased time bicyclists spend in the intersection after a full stop as compared to the safe yielding alternative.

According to data collected by the Delaware State Police, crashes involving bicycles at stop-sign controlled intersections fell by 23 percent in the 30 months after the state made the change, contributing to an 11 percent overall decrease in bicycle-involved crashes. Other states that have implemented this change noticed similar trends, and none reported an increase in riding collisions.

“Everyone agrees that bicycling is good for our communities,” said Dave Snyder, Executive Director of the California Bicycle Coalition, the bill's sponsor. “Yet we’re not doing enough to encourage people to ride bicycles and to make it safer. By removing unfair laws that turn otherwise law-abiding bike riders into law breakers and legalizing what most people on bikes are already doing, AB 122 moves us in that direction. It will improve predictability at intersections and mutual respect among road users, making riding a safer, more accessible option for Californians.” 

In addition, data from multiple major cities in California and elsewhere show that African American and Hispanic riders are disproportionately stopped and fined for moving violations - discouraging ridership in communities that stand to benefit from the mobility and lifestyle benefits that riding offers.

“Many cyclists already safely perform Idaho stops in California but are at risk of receiving a traffic ticket if they do so,” said Colin Parent, Executive Director of Circulate San Diego, a supporter of the bill. “Given that people of color can be disproportionately targeted for traffic stops, allowing Idaho stops also removes a potential for bias in traffic enforcement. I want to thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for her leadership in addressing climate change and promoting sustainable transportation with this important legislation.”

“As society moves increasingly toward cycling as an alternative to motor vehicle transportation, we have an imperative to keep up with these shifts by supporting convenient and safe bike travel,” said Andy Hanshaw, Executive Director of the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition, a supporter of the bill. “Legalizing this reasonable practice of treating stop signs as yield signs will make intersections much safer for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists while eliminating a common pretext for the over-policing of communities of color.” 

AB 122 is supported by a coalition of thousands of bike riders and dozens of climate, justice, and public health-oriented community organizations. It now moves to the State Senate for consideration.

In 2019, the landmark California Consumer Privacy Act passed, allowing consumers greater ability to protect their personal contact information from being shared. Certain exceptions allowed under later legislation gave car dealers the ability to share that information so consumers could receive important safety recall and warranty information for their vehicles. AB 335 simply extends that same exception to watercraft dealers so people get the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe while on the water. 
 
“California is and should remain a national leader when it comes to empowering people to take charge of their personal data, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t important exceptions,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Just like car dealers, watercraft dealers want to ensure owners get timely recall and safety information without running afoul of privacy protections. This bill will enable sellers to contact consumers and will keeps folks out of harm’s way while they’re enjoying our oceans, lakes, and waterways.”
Even though federal law requires such information be shared when a watercraft is purchased, the California Consumer Privacy Act makes it problematic to do so when a consumer chooses to exercise their privacy rights under the state law.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Restore Fairness to UC Admissions Passes the Assembly Higher Education Committee,2021-04-08,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 233, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to reform UC Admissions practices to restore fairness and prevent influence by the wealthy and well-connected, passed the Assembly Higher Education Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan 12-0 vote.

In May of 2019, while the news of the FBI’s Varsity Blues investigation was breaking, implicating several UC campuses, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath requested a state-level audit of the system’s admissions practices. After the State Auditor’s Office released a report detailing the inappropriate admissions of 64 wealthy applicants and a lack of consistent decision criteria, Boerner Horvath and Assemblymember Kevin McCarthy introduced AB 233 and AB 1215, joint-authored tandem bills that capture the Auditor’s key recommendations.

“As a proud UC Berkeley graduate, I’ve witnessed first-hand the value of a public higher education” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “These abuses shouldn’t be acceptable at any institution, let alone our taxpayer-supported system. The Auditor’s findings demonstrate flaws extending beyond the now famous examples of privileged manipulation — they reveal how inconsistent practices deny worthy applicants the opportunities to get ahead that they deserve. This bill gets to the core of what’s gone wrong to ensure equitable access to higher education for all Californians.”
In response to the report’s findings on systemic weaknesses in application review, AB 233 requests that the UC Office of the President implement new policies on consistent and unbiased decision-making, with reviewer trainings to make sure these new criteria are being used. The Office must report annually to the Legislature on how each campus is implementing these procedures and what actions have been taken to prevent inappropriate interaction between admissions staff and other university departments.

“College admissions are stressful enough as it is,” said Alan Calderon, undergraduate student and External Vice President at UC Irvine. “We shouldn’t have to pray that we get lucky with an application reviewer who will do their job impartially, and who you know and how much money your family has should never be determining factor in admissions. The prestige of the UC is contingent on a strict reform of this process to make sure that the students attending our university are those who truly worked for it. Out of respect for students and hardworking families across the state, this bill needs to be implemented.”

AB 233’s companion, AB 1215, responds to incidents of bought-and-paid-for acceptances by installing a strict firewall between admissions and philanthropy staff. The bill also requires the verification of an applicant’s participation in a sport before and after their arrive on campus — a direct response to some of the more extreme tactics used by wealthy parents to forge the legitimacy of their child’s admission.

""We must create admissions practices that allow every hardworking, deserving California student a fair shot at earning a seat at the table,” said Assemblymember Kevin McCarty. “By preventing pressure from philanthropic donations and a stricter oversight of athletics, we can provide a fair admissions process for all.”

While Office of the President has begun implementing reforms in line with its own audit, the State Auditor’s report makes clear that the internal recommendations did not address significant aspects of the UC admissions process – namely the inadequate training and lack of monitoring of application reviewers. The audit also finds that Office of the President lacks a minimum set of protocols and procedures to guard against improper decisions and has failed to monitor the admissions practices at all nine UC undergraduate campuses.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Sexual Assault Victims’ Social Media Privacy Bill Passes Assembly,2021-04-08,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 341, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen a sexual assault victim’s right to privacy by requiring social media content to go through the same process as other evidence in these types of trials, passed out of the Assembly with an overwhelmingly bipartisan 72-0 vote.

Increasingly in sexual assault cases, decades of social media activity is being mined and admitted into evidence that is irrelevant to the case at hand, but has the result of embarrassing, shaming, or humiliating a victim, sometimes to the point of discouraging their testimony. AB 341 simply requires that social media content go through the same submission of evidence procedures as other types of evidence covered under existing Rape Shield Laws.

“Rape Shield Laws need to be updated to account for the widespread use of social media so that victims seeking justice for their attackers won’t have their entire online lives on display for public scrutiny,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “I am proud to see this initiative moving forward, especially with such significant, bipartisan support.”
Since its passage in 1974, the California Rape Shield Law has been repeatedly amended to account for evolving technology and other factors impacting the types of material and information being submitted in sexual assault cases that require the defense to prove relevancy before being admitted as evidence. AB 341 still allows the defense to admit social media material – it simply expands the Rape Shield Law to require that the defense must file the same sort of written motion for a court ruling on relevancy if the content does not contain a statement, image, video, or picture of the alleged offense.

""AB 341 will bring us closer to a world where survivors of rape will feel safe enough to report a sexual assault and be willing to testify against their perpetrator,” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the sponsor of the bill. “Requiring that a judicial officer review and rule the social media evidence is relevant and admissible before it is used by the defense to attack the witness’s credibility is one small but incredibly important step in the long struggle to protect the dignity of all rape survivors.""

“Social media platforms have provided opportunities for defense attorneys to gather information to impugn the credibility of crime victims and cause additional and unneeded trauma,” said Harriet Salarno, Chair of Crime Victims United, a supporter of the bill. “There is a pressing need to protect victims of sexual assault from electronic platforms being used in criminal proceedings. AB 341 will truly help victims of sexual assault to have the courage to report and testify to protect our communities. I want to thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for authoring this bill.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Bill to Incentivize Electric Bicycle Purchases Passes the Assembly Transportation Committee,2021-04-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 117, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill establishing an electric bicycle purchase incentive program to help more people switch to sustainable commuting options, passed the Assembly Transportation Committee on a 11-0 bipartisan vote.

Despite their convenience of use and potential to promote healthy living, e-bikes remain unaffordable for most Californians. A good quality e-bike can cost between $600 and $10,000. These steep costs prevent many lower income Californians from switching to this low-maintenance, zero-emission alternative for short trips.

“While we continue to invest in electrifying transportation, we can’t leave e-bikes out of the conversation,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “For folks living in multifamily apartments with garages that lack EV plug-ins, electric cars simply aren’t yet workable. With this rebate program in place, we’ll get more Californians out of their cars and cut emissions from thousands of daily trips, supercharging our state’s progress toward our 2030 climate goals.”

According to the California Household Travel Survey, more than fifteen percent of vehicle trips in the state are less than one mile, and eighty percent are less than ten. As e-bikes have gained in popularity, evidence shows commuting is a dominant reason people make the purchase. A recent survey of North American e-bike owners found that nearly half (46 percent) of e-bike trips replace car commutes, at an average of 9.3 miles per trip.

“In addition to their benefits to our public health and safety, electric bikes can accomplish almost all of the trips that electric cars can — including taking children to school and hauling heavy loads — and for a fraction of the cost,” said Dave Snyder, Executive Director of the California Bicycle Coalition, the bill’s sponsor. “Yet California lags behind world leaders in adoption of this technology. The California Bicycle Coalition is thrilled to sponsor this bill to move California forward toward a healthier, more sustainable future for our state.”

In an effort to reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels in just a decade, California is gearing up to invest an additional $1.5 billion to promote electric vehicle purchases and bolster charging infrastructure. The state’s Clean Cars 4 All program currently incentivizes trade-ins for credit toward the purchase of hybrid and zero-emission vehicles, including e-bikes. Despite their usefulness in the race to cut emissions, these initiatives fall short for commuters who don’t own a car or can’t trade one in for an e-bike voucher.

“E-bikes are a real and equitable solution for many folks' everyday transportation needs, especially first and last mile problems,” said Vista City Council Member Corinna Contreras, a supporter of the bill. “The current cost of e-bikes makes them inaccessible to most in our community, especially for families with children that would need to purchase several bikes. I want to thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for taking up this bill and working to make sure people from all backgrounds can take part in a more sustainable future for our state.” 

AB 117 acknowledges the equity gaps inherent in the state’s current approach and seeks to fill them with purchase incentives that will make e-bikes a more widely attractive alternative to car trips — and in some cases — car purchases.

The bill already enjoys support from dozens of community-based organizations throughout the state. It now moves on for a vote in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Announces Jaqueline “Kiki” Bispo as 2021 Woman of the Year for Assembly District 76,2021-03-30,press_release,NA,"
 

SACRAMENTO — As part of Women’s History Month, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath honors Jacqueline “Kiki” Bispo as the 2021 Woman of the Year for Assembly District 76. In the month of March, State Legislators select a woman in their district whose contributions to her community deserve to be celebrated to be given this annual honor.
Bispo is a lifelong educator currently serving as the Family and Community Engagement Lead for Vista Unified School District. The Family and Community Engagement Network (F.A.C.E), a program concept that Bispo created, is an internationally recognized approach to student success that focuses on the role of the family, home life, and learning conditions in determining classroom outcomes for struggling students — a departure from the historically unsuccessful focus on academic performance alone.
“We know that kids who have both parents engaged in their kid’s learning and in touch with their teachers do better in school and have more opportunities later in life,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We also know that for many working families from underserved communities, providing a struggling kid with the necessary at-home support can be near impossible. Kiki’s innovative approach brings parents into the conversation, bridging that gap and resulting in better outcomes for struggling kids. Her work empowers families and makes Vista a more equitable place for kids to learn and grow. She is truly a hero for so many parents and she deserve to be celebrated.”
Since its implementation, the FACE Network has continued to boost the number of “family engagement events” at Vista schools, in some cases doubling the previous year’s numbers. The strengthening of family contact has allowed schools to make significant inroads in understanding and addressing issues like the chronic absenteeism and behavioral patterns that consistently hold students back from reaching their true potential. When the pandemic hit and schools switched to remote learning, the connections forged through Kiki’s program made all the difference in keeping students engaged while at home. 
“Ever since I was a kid myself, I’ve known I wanted to grow up to become an educator” said Bispo. “After years teaching in the classroom and noticing trends in what causes students to struggle, I knew I was called to take action to empower disenfranchised families. It’s been a privilege to take the lead on the FACE Network, and I cherish every day that I get to serve parents and students with love and compassion. I’m honored to accept this recognition from Assemblymember Boerner Horvath.”
The Woman of the Year program has a proud 30-year history in the Legislature, dating back its creation in 1987 by Assemblywoman Bev Hansen (R) and Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D). While honorees would typically visit the State Capitol to be recognized, the Legislature hosted a virtual celebration this year. Bispo’s accomplishments were also celebrated during the 76th Assembly District’ Women of Impact virtual event on March 26.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Fund Research into Bluff Collapse Early Warning System Passes Assembly Natural Resources Committee,2021-03-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 66, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to allocate $2.5 million to accelerate the science behind bluff failures and start the development of an early warning notification system for California’s coastal bluff collapses, passed the Assembly Natural Resources Committee on an 8-1 vote.
With fatalities, injuries, and millions of dollars in property damage just in the last few years, bluff failures are a constant threat to beachgoers and coastal neighborhoods throughout California. The worst impacts of these collapses, especially the loss of life, could be avoided with a bluff collapse early warning notification system. AB 66 would task the Scripps Institution of Oceanography with creating the science on when and why bluffs fail, as well as develop how to better predict bluff failures to increase public safety.
“What happened to the three women in 2019 in Leucadia and, tragically, to other valued members of our communities up and down the state, is unacceptable and we must use science and data-driven innovation to keep our communities safer,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Fortunately, we have a great partner in our backyard with Scripps and while AB 66 focuses on the area from Torrey Pines to Oceanside, the information we will gather will be invaluable for our state.”
In August of 2019, Anne Clave, Julie Davis, and Elizabeth Cox tragically passed away after a 30-by-25 heavy sandstone chunk broke loose and fell onto the three women who were sunbathing at Grandview Beach in Encinitas. In February of that same year, a San Francisco woman was fatally trapped after a similar collapse occurred at Fort Funston, burying her under tons of dirt.
“This bill can significantly advance research on the dynamics of cliff collapse along California's coastlines,” said Mark Zumberge, a Research Geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “With funding from this bill we would aim to gain a better understanding of the processes leading up to cliff failures . . . our goal is to learn how deformations are impacted by tides, large surf, groundwater, and rainfall to see if we can answer the question of whether signals exist that can forecast where and when an increased risk for collapse is developing.”
Actively eroding cliffs, which make up the majority of the state’s coastline, also threaten billions in development in the form of houses, highways, military bases, universities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. As recently as this month, bluff collapses in a particularly vulnerable portion of the coast in Del Mar narrowed the cliff to within 35 feet of the railroad tracks that connect the San Diego region to the remainder of the state, placing the second busiest commercial rail corridor in the country yet again in jeopardy of being severed.
“We know a lot about long-term trends, including cliff retreat and what can make them collapse,” said Dwight Worden, Deputy Mayor of the City of Del Mar. “What we don’t know is what’s likely to come down now — we can’t tell you if it’s safe to lay your towel on the beach in this location, and this is a huge issue for local cities. This bill will provide critical funds to take us to the next step towards saving lives, and there is no one better to do that than the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.”
As with many other environmental threats, the problem is only made worse by climate change and ensuing sea-level rise. U.S. Geological Service scientists have forecasted that coastal cliffs in Southern California could crumble at more than twice the historical rate by 2100 if the current pace of annual shoreline rise continues unabated. 
The increased scientific understanding of the processes of bluff failures that AB 66 funding makes possible will empower California to take action in combatting this threat and building a safer, more resilient future for coastal communities.
The bill will be heard next in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath's Sexual Assault Victims’ Social Media Privacy Bill Passes Assembly Public Safety Committee,2021-03-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 341, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen a sexual assault victim’s right to privacy by requiring social media content to go through the same process as other evidence in these types of trials, passed the Assembly Public Safety Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote.
Increasingly in sexual assault cases, decades of social media activity is being mined and admitted into evidence that is irrelevant to the case at hand, but has the result of embarrassing, shaming, or humiliating a victim, sometimes to the point of discouraging their testimony. AB 341 simply requires that social media content go through the same submission of evidence procedures as other types of evidence covered under existing Rape Shield Laws.
 
“We already have laws on the books to help ensure victims seeking justice for their attackers won’t have their entire lives subjected to public scrutiny, and those protections should be extended to their social media activity as well” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Character assassination and the rehashing of a victim’s sexual history are largely ruled irrelevant in assault cases, but Rape Shield Laws need to be updated to account for the realities of our online lives so that sexual assault victims can seek justice and keep their dignity intact.”
Since its passage in 1974, the California Rape Shield Law has been repeatedly amended to account for evolving technology and other factors impacting the types of material and information being submitted in sexual assault cases that require the defense to prove relevancy before being admitted as evidence. AB 341 still allows the defense to admit social media material – it simply expands the Rape Shield Law to require that the defense must file the same sort of written motion for a court ruling on relevancy if the content does not contain a statement, image, video, or picture of the alleged offense.
""AB 341 will bring us closer to a world where survivors of rape will feel safe enough to report a sexual assault and be willing to testify against their perpetrator,” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the sponsor of the bill. “Requiring that a judicial officer review and rule the social media evidence is relevant and admissible before it is used by the defense to attack the witness’s credibility is one small but incredibly important step in the long struggle to protect the dignity of all rape survivors.""
 
The bill next moves to a vote by the full Assembly before heading to the State Senate for their review.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Commemorates 109th Anniversary of Girl Scouts of the USA,2021-03-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — To commemorate the occasion of the 109th Anniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts of the USA, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s ACR 22 passed the Assembly on a consent vote.
With about 2.6 million youth and adult members, Girl Scouts of the USA is currently the largest leadership organization for young women in the world. Since founder Juliette Gordon Low brought together the first troop on March 12, 1912, millions of young women have found their passion, their voice, and their calling through scouting. Today, former girl scouts dominate the ranks of women legislators, business executives, astronauts, and creative leaders. Many of these professionals can trace the inspiration for their career paths back to their time as scouts.
 
“As the mother of a 10-year-old Junior Scout in Troop 1920, I’ve seen firsthand the value that scouting provides for young people as they discover themselves through childhood and adolescence,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “My daughter is going to become an adult in a world full of challenges that are going to demand a different kind of thinking from her generation. Girl Scouts provides the validation that our daughters need to see themselves as the change-makers of tomorrow, no matter where their interests lead them.”
While Girl Scouts is known by many for its wildly successful annual cookie sales, the organization also has a proud history of empowering girls to explore their interests in the areas less enforced by cultural norms — namely science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. A 2012 study conducted by the Girl Scouts Research Institute found that 74% of teen girls aged 14-17 demonstrated an interest in one or more STEM-related fields. By providing girls with opportunities to engage with their interests outside of the classroom, scouting empowers young women to pursue rewarding career paths that validate their sense of self.
ACR 22 celebrates the more than a century-long history of Girl Scouts of the USA and expresses the Legislature’s support of its mission to instill courage, confidence, and character in the youth of today.

Tasha Boerner,Legislature Passes $6.6 Billion Safe School Reopening Plan,2021-03-04,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, the Legislature passed a $6.6 billion early budget bill to bring students back to the classroom safely and address the educational impacts of the pandemic. AB 86 seeks to balance the need to get children back into the classroom with the real challenges school districts are facing.
“Everyone can agree that the need to get students back in the classroom is urgent – particularly for those from underserved communities with working parents,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “As a mom of two kids in public schools, I have been working to balance the safety of our schools with the need for student success since the pandemic started. The plan we passed today is a big step forward to ensuring we provide the necessary resources, implement safety protocols, and do everything we can to ensure our children, as well as the teachers and staff who educate them, can safely return to in-person instruction. While not perfect, this agreement is a much needed $6.6 billion investment in our schools to hopefully help our children come back from this year stronger and more successful than ever.”
School districts located in CDPH-designated “purple tier” counties that wish to receive their share of the $2 billion in one-time Proposition 98 funds will need to submit school safety plans and return all TK-2 students to in-person learning by March 31. Those located in “red tier” counties will need to do the same for all TK-6 students by March 31, and all districts need to bring back vulnerable students in TK-12 by that date in order to receive the full funding. After March 31, school districts will be penalized by 1% for each day in-person instruction has not returned, with full forfeiture if the return is not accomplished by May 15.
San Diego County has been a leader among urban counties since the first vaccine shipments arrived and continues its aggressive efforts to vaccinate teachers, essential workers, and the most vulnerable. Due to the region’s diligent adherence to public health guidance, a return to the “red tier” is now imminent. In Assembly District 76, all elementary schools have or will be open by this deadline and most middle and high schools are in the active process of reopening, with three districts requesting waivers from the California Department Public Health to potentially reopen their middle and high schools in the next few weeks.
“There has been much misinformation about AB 86 and I want to be clear — there is nothing in AB 86 that would prevent any of my schools from implementing or expanding their reopening plans and on the contrary, it provides my districts with the funding and support they need to safely support continued reopening across our district,” emphasized Boerner Horvath. “There is so much more we need to do for our kids, but this bill is an important step towards delivering what our schools, families, communities, and especially our students, need.”
The remaining $4.56 billion in one-time Proposition 98 funding is designated for multi-year learning loss mitigation plans, with allocations determined using the Local Control Funding Formula. Funding can be used for everything from increased instructional support to school year extensions, summer school programs, and personalized counseling and tutoring services to address the broad range of social and emotional impacts that may emerge in the wake of the pandemic. The plan also requires that the 10 percent of the vaccine supply the state has already begun setting aside for teachers and school staff be made available to the schools that are actively reopening or have a plan to do so by May 15.
AB 86 was the product of months of negotiation between the Assembly, Senate, and the Governor, and now moves to his desk for signature.

Tasha Boerner,"Legislature Passes $9.6 Billion COVID-19 Early Budget Package to Support Struggling Small Businesses, Workers",2021-02-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today the Legislature passed a COVID-19 relief early action budget package on a bipartisan basis, clearing the way for the timely dispersal of $9.6 billion in additional small business grants, childcare funding, tax cuts, and $600 direct payments to millions of struggling Californians. Last week, Legislative leadership came to an agreement with the Governor on the details for the package after weeks of collaboration on how to meet the critical need for more relief to bolster the eventual recovery.
“Nearly a year into this crisis, our state finds itself at a tipping point — if we don’t act fast to get people the relief they need, we’ll be setting ourselves up for a longer, slower, and ultimately more expensive recovery” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This package represents a sizable investment in the foundations of our state’s economy and will provide a bridge for millions of struggling Californians to make it to the other side of this crisis. While I would have preferred to have total tax exemption for small businesses on the PPP and disaster loan money they’ve spent since last year, this compromise on a $150,000 cap still means a full deduction will be possible for nearly 90 percent of loan recipients. I look forward to working with this Administration to ensure the timely and equitable distribution of these funds to those in need.”
In addition to the tax deductions for federal loans spent, the early relief package allocates $2.1 billion to quadruple the state’s investment in its California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant program, which has administered grants of up to $25,000 to thousands of businesses and nonprofits to date. To support low-income Californians, the package provides $2.8 billion in tax rebates and another billion for $600 Golden State Stimulus payments for more than 5.7 million eligible recipients.
The package of budget-related bills now moves to the Governor for his signature so this essential relief can be delivered to millions of California families, workers, and businesses.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Issues Statement on New Youth Sports Guidance,2021-02-19,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Today, the California Department of Public Health announced the issuance of new guidance for a variety of athletic settings that will make it possible for outdoor practice and competitions to resume with rigid safety protocols in place. Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues and wrote to Governor Newsom expressing my support for a return to outdoor youth sports contingent on workable, science-driven guidelines for how do so safely. While the increased pace of vaccinations and consistent drops in community spread signal the opportunity to proceed cautiously with getting our young athletes back out there, we will need everyone involved following recommendations to limit further surges.
We know that sitting out the season does more than just take away time on the field, the court, the water, or in the pool — it can have a serious toll on our children’s mental health, particularly in more disadvantaged communities. This new guidance is built on a rigorous analysis of the data from other states where activities have resumed, provides state resources to conduct periodic testing for high-contact sports, and facilitates collaboration with coaches and other stakeholders on how to implement these risk mitigation plans across all settings.
As a mom, I know how important it is for kids to get outside and be active, for both their physical and mental well-being. As a legislator, I have a duty to protect the communities I represent and to follow the science where it leads us in our collective efforts to prevent loss of life. I hope that given this chance, coaches, trainers, and parents will act responsibly and make a good faith effort to follow these public health guidelines so we can get our kids back out there safely.

Tasha Boerner,New Vista Vaccination Clinic Opens at Existing Testing Facility,2021-02-15,press_release,NA,"VISTA — Starting this week, the County of San Diego began operating a new COVID-19 vaccination clinic at the Linda Rhoades Recreation Center in Vista. The center, which is located at 600 North Santa Fe Avenue, has been operational as a COVID-19 testing facility since November 11th. To avoid cross-traffic between eligible vaccine recipients and potentially COVID-19 positive individuals, vaccinations will be administered on non-testing days, Sundays and Mondays from 9:30am to 3:30pm.

Last October, when case numbers were increasing in the region, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath took the lead in convening a partnership between the Vista Unified School District, the City of Vista, and San Diego County’s Health and Human Services Agency to expand no-cost, walk in testing in the hardest hit areas of North County. This collaboration led to the opening of the Linda Rhoades site, which has since tested thousands of residents, filling the access gap in that community. As vaccination began ramping up, Boerner Horvath took the same approach — pushing for the addition of a vaccination clinic at the Vista site.

“We know that our underserved communities are often the hardest hit in this pandemic” said Boerner Horvath. “Ever since this crisis began, I’ve been focused on ensuring that resources are being deployed equitably so that testing, tracing, treatment — and now vaccinations — reach everyone, no matter where they live. It’s great to see how our hard work from last fall to expand testing is now making it easier to bring vaccinations to Vista residents. I’m grateful to Councilmember Corinna Contreras and School Board Trustee Martha Alvarado for their work on this and to Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Nora Vargas for their continued attention to our needs in North County.”
“Assemblymember Boerner Horvath fought for her district to have access to vaccines, we heard the request and as part of our commitment to equitable distribution of the vaccine, the County made it happen,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “This vaccination site is another example of our investment and commitment to finding solutions that get us out of this pandemic, get our kids back in the classroom, restore our economy and put our entire community on a path toward recovery.”

“The testing site at Linda Rhoades Recreation Center has been successfully utilized by our Vista community,” said Vista Councilmember Corinna Contreras. “As a walkable site on our busy North Santa Fe corridor, all of our community is able to easily access the site for testing purposes and now, for vaccination as well. This collaborative work between various levels of government and organizations has brought much needed services to Vista in a time when they are crucial to the health of our community during this unprecedented pandemic.”

“The expansion of Linda Rhodes Recreation Center to provide COVID-19 vaccinations on Sundays and Mondays will help address the equity gap for the hardest hit neighborhoods in Vista,” said Vista Unified School Board Trustee Martha Alvarado. “I look forward to the state acquiring more vaccines and possibly adding another day to the vaccination schedule.”

This new clinic joins the sites in Del Mar, Carlsbad, Oceanside, San Marcos, and Escondido for a total of six county-administered vaccination locations in North County. Assemblymember Boerner Horvath will continue working with both county and city officials on culturally competent ways to increase awareness of these new vaccine services, especially within underserved senior communities.

Hard working Californians who have lost their incomes do not deserve to find themselves on the street with their families. Small landlords need to be able to cover their costs too. This is no one’s fault — but help is needed.
That’s why we’ve extended the moratorium on evictions to June 30, 2021, with applications for assistance becoming available starting in mid-March. This legislation continues the promise we made last year to help renters and landlords have the relief they both need to weather this ongoing storm. There is still much to do to help meet this challenge, and we all need to continue doing what it takes to stay safe during this time. To do that, people need to have a roof over their heads. By leveraging federal relief in this way, we can help keep many people in their homes.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Votes in Support of Resolution Calling for President Trump’s Removal,2021-01-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath issued the following statement in Support of Assembly House Resolution 7 (H.R. 7), which passed today out of the State Assembly with 51 votes:
“The strength of our Republic rests in respecting our democratic institutions, and our ability to respond to the challenges we face, including COVID, require that we have a functioning and stable government. Well before November of last year, our current President did everything he could to undermine public faith in those institutions, including that most essential element for democracy to survive — the vote. 
Instead of accepting the will of the people and the rule of law, President Trump incited his followers, calling on them to march on the Capitol Building when Congress was meeting to certify the election. The disturbing and unprecedented attack that occurred is a direct result. 
We need to be honest about what the attack at the Capitol was and was not. It was, quite clearly, an anti-democratic act of domestic terrorism and insurrection designed to subvert the outcome of a democratic election and the rule of law. It was NOT, as some have suggested, an act of revolution on par with what our nation’s founders engaged in. 
Those who fought and died in our War of Independence did so to free people from tyranny and in furtherance of a democratic form of government. Those terrorists who stormed our nation’s Capital building last week did so at the behest of a would-be tyrant in order to destroy our democracy. These perpetrators do not deserve to be romanticized, they need to be prosecuted, and the one who goaded them into action should be removed from office. 
In order to get back to the people’s business, we need to first affirm faith in democracy and the rule of law by holding those responsible to account. First and foremost, among them should be President Trump. That is why I voted in support of, and joined as a co-author of, HR 7 today, a resolution calling for President Trump to either resign, be removed under the 25th Amendment, or be impeached and removed by Congress.”

Tasha Boerner,"Boerner Horvath, McCarty Announce Legislation Increasing Fairness, Transparency in UC Admissions",2020-12-18,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymembers Kevin McCarty and Tasha Boerner Horvath today announced planned companion legislation to address the most recent California State Auditor report on University of California (UC) admissions practices and recommended reforms.
The bills are in response to a State Auditor report issued on September 22nd of this year based on investigations conducted at four different UC campuses that concluded the University of California “has allowed for improper influence in admissions decisions, and it has not treated applicants fairly or consistently.” The report from the State Auditor concluded with 12 recommendations, much of which would be included in these two bills. 
“We’ve continued to see the stories in the news since the ‘Varsity Blues’ investigation became public last year, but what this audit revealed was underlying, systemic problems that have created a sometimes capricious admissions process” added Asm. Boerner Horvath, “This isn’t only about the wealthy and well-connected influencing admissions decisions, it’s about students being denied equal opportunity to an education simply because they had a different person review their application than another equally qualified student. It wouldn’t be acceptable at any institution, let alone our taxpayer-supported public university system.”
Boerner Horvath, who actually authored the audit request and is a UC graduate, is introducing a bill that tackles the overall admissions process, requiring policies and procedures that ensure a fair and impartial admissions process, including training for application reviewers and readers on the consistent and unbiased use of admissions criteria. These reforms would also include an annual review process to ensure these new requirements are being adhered to and that there is no inappropriate interaction between Admissions and other university departments.
“We must create admissions practices that allow every hardworking, deserving California student a fair shot at earning a seat at the table,” said Asm. McCarty, Chair of Assembly Budget Subcommittee for Education Finance, “By preventing pressure from philanthropic donations and a stricter oversight of athletics, we can provide a fair admissions process for all.” 
McCarty’s bill requires a firewall between admissions staff and a campus’s philanthropy staff to prevent pressure to admit students due to family donations. The bill also requires admissions staff to verify a student athlete’s athletic ability or talent prior to admissions and follow-up after admissions to ensure student participation in that sport. 
While both authors acknowledge there have been assurances and actions taken by the UC to address issues raised since they first came to light last year, what the State Audit reveals is that more significant reforms are needed to address the worst of the abuses relative to influencing admissions decisions, as well as deal with inconsistent and unfair admissions processes overall.
Both bills will start their path through the Legislature in the Assembly, beginning with the Assembly Committee on Higher Education.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Strengthen and Expand the Carlsbad Marine Hatchery Program Signed by Governor,2020-09-30,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1949, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen and expand the marine hatchery program in Carlsbad was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. 
The Leon Raymond Hubbard Jr. Marine Fish Hatchery in Carlsbad is the only salt-water fish hatchery on the West Coast and operates as the main facility for the Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP). As the longest-running program of this kind in the country, the OREHP has significantly contributed to the world’s understanding of how to successfully spawn, rear, and release saltwater fish. 
AB 1949 reforms the program in step with the core recommendations from a California Sea Grant evaluation conducted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the state’s request in 2015. This includes a restructuring of the program’s advisory panel so that it facilitates a more direct decision-making process while providing stakeholders with more appropriate representation, among other changes. 
“The combination of stakeholder control and independent oversight will ensure that taxpayer dollars that go towards hatchery operations are being used efficiently and in a way that benefits all of us,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This bill gives us a shot at securing a sustainable fishing future by equipping us with the tools needed to become effective stewards of our marine resources. I’m looking forward to everything that we’ll be able to accomplish with this new and improved program.”
When OREHP was established in 1982, it was specifically dedicated to refining hatchery operations for use in replenishing white seabass in Southern California. Research since then has identified 13 additional species that can benefit from the program’s cultivation efforts. AB 1949 updates current law to expand the scope of the program to include research on all species that have an economic impact on California. 
""In the 38 years since the OREHP was established, much has changed – both in our ocean environment and in the world of recreational angling,” said Bill Shedd, Chairman of the Coastal Conservation Association of California (CCA-CAL), the bill’s sponsor. “By optimizing the program for the needs of today, AB 1949 improves its usefulness and elevates the role of marine enhancement science in securing California’s sustainable fishing future. I want to thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for carrying this legislation and ushering in a brand-new chapter in the history of this one-of-a-kind facility.""
AB 1949 enjoys support from a broad coalition that includes conservationists along with sport and commercial fishermen. The new law goes into effect on January 1st, 2021.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Increase Justice for Sexual Assault Survivors Signed by Governor,2020-09-29,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1927, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill establishing an amnesty clause to encourage victims and witnesses of sexual assault to testify in court was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. 
AB 1927 provides immunity for victims and witnesses of sexual assault from the consequences of illegal alcohol or drug use occurring at the time of their alleged assault. Higher education institutions nationwide, including the University of California, have already implemented such amnesty clauses on their campuses.
“The signing of AB 1927 sends a strong message to the thousands of victims of sexual assault who remained silent – we hear you, we understand your fears, and your stories are valid,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “For too long, our judicial system has placed unnecessary burdens on victims seeking justice.”
Under current law, victims must go through a process that requires them to be compelled to testify in court before amnesty for alcohol or drug charges can be granted. This process unnecessarily increases trauma to the victim by requiring them to appear in front of a judge for offenses unrelated to the sexual assault. 
AB 1927 limits liability for drug-related or alcohol crimes only in the limited circumstance where the victim or witness testified in a sexual assault prosecution, and that the required testimony was incriminating. It does not prohibit the accused from introducing evidence that the accuser was under the influence. 
“Today, California passed a landmark law that lets victims of sexual assault know they will be protected and their dignity preserved when they come forward to report a crime and testify in court,” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, the bill's sponsor. “This new law removes another hurdle that contributes to the underreporting of sexual assault by victims who fear exposing themselves to criminal liability for drug or alcohol use, which is often used by a perpetrator to commit the crime against them. I want to thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for fighting on behalf of thousands of sexual assault victims who suffer in silence.”
“Victims of sexual assault should never be made to feel like they are the ones being tried for a crime in order to testify against their perpetrators,” said Harriett Salarno, Chair of Crimes Victims United of California (CVUC). “It's important to signal to victims that they don't need to be fearful of participating in the judicial system. The signing of AB 1927 into law brings us closer to a California where all victims of violent crime can be heard and seek the justice they are due.” 
Under this new law, communities will become safer as more perpetrators are held accountable for crimes and brought to justice. AB 1927 takes effect on January 1st, 2021.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Economic Recovery Bill to Save Jobs and Expand Unemployment Benefits to Employees on Reduced Hours Signed by Governor,2020-09-28,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1731, a bill authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) to incentivize businesses’ participation in the state’s Work Share Program and to expand the number of workers covered under partial unemployment assistance was signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. 
Under California’s unemployment insurance Work Share Program, businesses are able to reduce employees’ hours and wages as an alternative to layoffs as eligible workers receive prorated unemployment benefits to replace lost wages. Businesses retain valuable, trained workers on staff and workers keep their jobs and their benefits. 
“Our state is facing two parallel and related catastrophes,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “We will eventually defeat the health crisis if we follow public health orders and continue working towards an eventual vaccine or therapeutic. However, unless we act quickly to protect the health of our businesses and the resiliency of our workers, we run the risk of deepening and lengthening the economic crisis. AB 1731 puts us on track to meet these goals — it’s a win for business, a win for workers, and a win for California.” 
Despite the benefits of participating in the program, work-sharing has been widely underutilized because the application process can be slow, forcing businesses to layoffs as they wait for their application to be approved. Less than 1% of initial UI claims in California since the beginning of the pandemic have come from Work Sharing, whereas Michigan is at 7.4%.
To address this, AB 1731 creates a temporary, simplified work-sharing application process requiring EDD to deem all program applications approved upon receipt and send employers their claim packets electronically within 5 days after the application is approved. It also instructs the EDD to collaborate with the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development and the I-Bank on strategic methods to make sure employers are aware of the benefits of the program.
“Surviving the continuing economic fallout due to the coronavirus could be greatly improved by employers' participation in the State’s Work Share Program to help them retain a portion of their workforce and bring back laid off employees as the economy improves,” said Till von Wachter, UCLA Economics Professor and Director of the California Policy Lab at UCLA. “With potentially millions of dollars in underutilized federal funding available to accomplish this expansion, now is the time to put Work Sharing on the map to help struggling businesses and working families stay afloat throughout the recession and recovery.”
The bill contains an urgency clause, which means it goes into effect right away instead of at the beginning of next year. This allows California to take advantage of CARES Act funding available for states to use towards implementation and administration of short-time compensation programs before the end of the year. 
Now that it has been signed, AB 1731 takes effect immediately.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Permanently Protect San Onofre State Beach Signed by Governor,2020-09-25,press_release,NA,"
 
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1426, by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas), to enshrine in state law a settlement agreement protecting San Onofre State Beach from infrastructure development was signed by Governor Newsom. This marks the successful conclusion of what has been a nearly two-decade fight to save the iconic world class surf spot, Trestles, and the surrounding state park, which is enjoyed by more than 2.5 million yearly visitors.
AB 1426 prohibits any transportation agency or government entity from authorizing, funding, or constructing any new infrastructure that encroaches on the land currently protected by a combination of San Onofre State Beach and the Richard H. and Donna O’Neill Conservancy.
Ever since the early 2000’s, a broad coalition of conservation groups have advocated against the use of the park in a proposal to build a multi-lane extension from the Foothill south toll road in Orange County south to Highway 5. The signing of AB 1426 into law codifies the settlement reached in 2016 between the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency (TCA), the Save San Onofre Coalition, and the State that has prevented road construction to date.
“I am incredibly grateful to all of the amazing people who have kept the pressure up over all these years to bring us to this point,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This new law ensures that the hard work of everyone who fought to save this park cannot be undone. This is a huge victory for the cause of conservation in Southern California and for the future generations of surfers, bikers, hikers, and fishermen who will be able to enjoy this special park just as we have.”
In addition to being one of the top-five most visited parks in the entire system, San Onofre State Beach is also home to the last remaining undeveloped watershed in Southern California, the San Mateo Creek. Proposed road projects would have bisected the stretch of the park where the creek runs, ruining the popular campground and disturbing the habitats of some rare and endangered species.
“Signing AB 1426 into law provides the permanent protection for San Onofre State Beach that this critical state park deserves,” declared Rachel Norton, Executive Director of the California State Parks Foundation, the sponsor of the bill. “In this current pandemic, the importance and need for access to state parks and outdoor recreation has become clear. AB 1426’s passage ensures that the much-needed recreation and coastal access that San Onofre State Beach provides will not be threatened again.”
“The time, talent, and energy that thousands of Save San Onofre and Save Trestles supporters put in over the last two decades has finally been honored,” said Stefanie Sekich Quinn, Coastal Protection Manager for Surfrider Foundation. “For years, coastal advocates and park supporters led the charge for protecting the park and Trestles – whether it was packing numerous public hearings, attending surf events and paddle-outs, or lobbying legislators. We’re thrilled that Governor Newsom and the Legislature agree that protecting San Onofre State Beach is a clear state priority.”
“This is a huge win for California coastal protection,” said Damon Nagami, Senior Attorney and Director of the NRDC’s Southern California Ecosystems Project. “As we face a biodiversity crisis and inequitable access to nature, AB 1426 erases the threat of road construction through a popular state park that would harm endangered species and eliminate affordable coastal accommodations for low-income families. Governor Newsom’s signature cements these protections into law with bipartisan support.”
“San Onofre State Beach contains San Mateo Creek, the last remaining undammed coastal watershed in southern California,” said Dan Silver, Executive Director of the Endangered Habitats League. “The park is home to eleven threatened and endangered species whose survival rests on a protected, intact ecosystem. With AB 1426, we’ve not only preserved the park for our recreation and enjoyment, we’re helping those species survive and thrive.” 
The signing of AB 1426 ensures one of the state’s most beloved beaches will remain undisturbed at a time when local trips to enjoy the outdoors are more important than ever. The new law will take effect on January 1st, 2021.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Comments on Findings of State Auditor’s Report on UC Admissions Issues,2020-09-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO — Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) issued the following statement responding to the release of the California State Auditor’s report on University of California admissions, an audit she requested in May of 2019:
“The State Audit released today on the UC Admission process unfortunately reveals much of what we suspected – that our UC admissions process is far too vulnerable to manipulation by well-connected individuals. These practices undermine the equality of opportunity in the UC system and the State of California and are especially troublesome given that these are prestigious taxpayer-supported public institutions.
As a UC Berkeley alumna, this is personal for me. I know that my admission to Cal set me on a path to success tat I would not have had otherwise. As a legislator, I’m committed to ensuring that our public higher educational institutions guarantee a fair process for all California students.
The results of this audit uncovered previously unknown issues separate from the back-door exceptions we’ve been learning about ever since the FBI released its “Varsity Blues” investigations more than a year ago. In addition to 64 questionable admissions decisions flagged by the State Auditor, the report also concluded that some campuses have major inconsistencies amongst application reviewers and lack basic criteria to support their admissions decisions.
This report is about more than just the affluent and powerful buying their way into our public universities. It is also about the stifled dreams of high-achieving students, sometimes from difficult circumstances who are denied their opportunity because of the inequity of access. We must end these practices and ensure that the admission offices and reviewers implement best practices that are transparent and accountable to the public.
With AB 1383 (McCarty) we took some initial steps towards improving this system, and the results of this state audit reveal there is more work to do. My colleagues and I will be meeting with stakeholders to ensure the State Auditor’s recommendations are implemented in full. The students, businesses, and taxpayers of California deserve no less.”

Tasha Boerner,Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside Selected as 2020 Nonprofit of the Year for Assembly District 76,2020-09-15,press_release,NA,"
OCEANSIDE – Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath honors the Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside as the 2020 California Nonprofit of the Year for Assembly District 76.
Each year, California Assemblymembers and State Senators select a nonprofit from their district to be recognized for their work to provide services to those in need, promote social change, and improve the quality of life in their communities.
The club was selected because of its tireless dedication to support the underserved youth of the Oceanside community as working families navigate the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The staff quickly identified food insecurity and distance learning inequities as some of the areas of greatest needs for the low income and minority families and created programs tailored to address them.
“This pandemic and the economic downturn it caused has really hit working families the hardest,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “The Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside has been listening to the needs of families and has truly gone above and beyond to meet them where they’re at during this difficult time. The club’s efforts over the past six months have helped keep Oceanside students on track while lessening some of the burdens their parents are facing.” 
Ever since it first arrived in Oceanside more than 67 years ago, the Boys and Girls Club has worked to provide a safe, fun, and enriching environment for the youth of the community to spend their after-school hours. The circumstances of the pandemic meant that youth weren’t able to gather at the facilities for hands-on enrichment programs. The club quickly pivoted to, among other things, transition the use of its kitchen facilities for daily meal pickups and launch its Back2School program to provide virtual instructional support and close the connectivity divide.
“During these unprecedented times, BGCO staff have worked around the clock to ensure that at-risk youth have the support they need while school closures continue,” said Jodi Diamond, CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of Oceanside. “We are incredibly grateful and deeply humbled to be recognized by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath as a Nonprofit of the Year.”
This is the fifth year of the California Nonprofit of the Year initiative, and with nonprofits doing more than ever to help their communities weather this COVID-19 crisis, their work should rightfully be celebrated.
“Nonprofits are often hidden in plain sight,” said Jan Masaoka, CEO of the California Association of Nonprofits (CalNonprofits). “With one in every 14 California jobs being at a nonprofit, honoring a California Nonprofit of the Year shows that elected officials recognize and celebrate the good work they see nonprofits doing in their districts. We urge everyone to appreciate the collective impact of nonprofits in our communities.”

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Economic Recovery Bill to Save Jobs and Expand Unemployment Benefits to Employees on Reduced Hours Headed to Governor’s Desk,2020-08-31,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO — AB 1731, a bill authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) to incentivize businesses’ participation in the state’s Work Share Program, passed the Assembly on a bipartisan 74-0 concurrence vote. 
Under California’s unemployment insurance Work Share Program, businesses are able to reduce employees’ hours and wages as an alternative to layoffs as eligible workers receive prorated unemployment benefits to replace lost wages. Businesses retain valuable, trained workers on staff and workers keep their jobs and their benefits. Despite the benefits of participating in the program, work-sharing has been widely underutilized because the application process can be slow forcing businesses to layoffs as they wait for their application to be approved. 
“Business owners who want to keep their employees when times are tough should have access to an expedited process for starting a work-sharing plan and avoid unnecessary layoffs” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “And, workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own will be more likely to accept a part-time job knowing that their unemployment benefits will not be significantly offset by their wages. Preserving the relationships between businesses and their workers are going to be critical to the quality and speed of our economic recovery.” 
AB 1731 would create a temporary, simplified work-sharing application process requiring EDD to deem all program applications approved upon receipt and send employers their claim packets electronically within 5 days after the application is approved. To boost participation, the bill instructs the EDD to collaborate with the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development and the I-Bank on strategic methods to make sure employers are aware of the benefits of the program. 
“Expediting Work Sharing applications and increasing outreach to employers, as this bill seeks to do, will help to overcome well-known hurdles of expanding the Work Sharing program,” said UCLA Economics Professor Till von Wachter, a supporter of the bill. “Acting now and decisively is important, since Work Sharing benefits are paid for by the federal government until December 2020.” 
The federal CARES Act reimburses states for Work Share benefit payments and includes $100 million to cover implementation and administration costs. By expanding its program before the end of the year, California could take advantage of this funding and alleviate some of its own pandemic-related cost burdens. 
AB 1731 is now headed to the Governor’s desk for his consideration.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Make it Safe for Sexual Assault Survivors to Testify in Court Headed to Governor’s Desk,2020-08-30,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — Today, AB 1927, Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s bill establishing an amnesty clause to encourage victims and witnesses of sexual assault to testify in court passed the Assembly Floor on a bipartisan 75-0 concurrence vote.
AB 1927 would provide immunity for victims and witnesses of sexual assault from the consequences of illegal alcohol or drug use occurring at the time of their alleged assault. Higher education institutions nationwide, including the University of California, have already implemented such amnesty clauses on their campuses.
“Victims of sexual assault who were under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the abuse are more reluctant to testify against their assailants for fear of personal prosecution,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This fear should not be the reason to stop them from getting the justice they deserve. AB 1927 will provide assault survivors with a safe space to provide testimony before a judge without incriminating them for their behavior.”
Under current law, victims must go through a process that requires them to be compelled to testify in court before amnesty for alcohol or drug charges can be granted. This process unnecessarily increases trauma to the victim by requiring them to appear in front of a judge for offenses unrelated to the sexual assault.
“On behalf of Crime Victims United of California (CVUC), I am pleased to support AB 1927,” said Harriet Salarno, Chair of the CVUC. “This bill will remedy the underreporting of sexual assault cases by creating a statutory vehicle by which California’s criminal justice system can provide victims and witnesses of sexual assault relief from potential criminal liability from self-incriminating testimony about their minor drug and alcohol-related offenses as it relates to the sexual assault case.
AB 1927 limits liability for drug-related or alcohol crimes only in the limited circumstance where the victim or witness testified in a sexual assault prosecution, and that the required testimony was incriminating. It does not prohibit the accused from introducing evidence that the accuser was under the influence.
While many colleges and universities have already adopted this practice, AB 1927 would expand the amnesty clause to all victims of sexual assault. Every victim deserves to come forward without fear of being liable for minor violations of underage drinking or drug use.
The bill is headed to the Governor’s Desk to receive his signature.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Strengthen and Expand the Carlsbad Marine Hatchery Program Headed to Governor’s Desk,2020-08-30,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1949, Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen and expand the marine hatchery program in Carlsbad passed the Assembly Floor on a bipartisan 75-0 concurrence vote.
The Leon Raymond Hubbard Jr. Marine Fish Hatchery in Carlsbad is the only salt-water fish hatchery on the West Coast and operates as the main facility for the Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP). The hatchery has historically been used to experiment with techniques for using cultivated white seabass to enhance their depleted wild populations.
AB 1949 reforms the program in step with the core recommendations from a California Sea Grant evaluation conducted by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the state’s request in 2015. This includes a restructuring of the program’s advisory panel so that it facilitates a more direct decision-making process while providing stakeholders with more appropriate representation, among other changes.
“At a time when climate change continues to put strain on the world’s oceans, we need to be finding more innovate ways to balance our commercial and sport fishing industries with the need to safeguard against overfishing,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “This bill gives us a shot at securing a sustainable fishing future by equipping us with the tools needed to become effective stewards of our marine resources.”
When OREHP was established in 1982, it was specifically dedicated to refining hatchery operations for use in replenishing white seabass in Southern California. Research since then conducted by the Hubbard Sea World Research Institute has identified 13 additional species that can benefit from the program’s cultivation efforts. AB 1949 updates current law to expand the scope of the program to include research on all species that have an economic impact on California.
""On behalf of the Coastal Conservation Association of California (CCA-CAL), proud sponsors of AB 1949, we thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for her leadership in moving this bill forward” said Bill Shedd, who also serves as Chairman of the OREHP Advisory Panel. “This legislation will allow for the State to continue to invest in the science and research necessary to adapt to inevitable changes in the marine environment and usher in new productivity at this amazing facility.”
AB 1949 enjoys support from a broad coalition that includes conservationists along with sport and commercial fishermen. It now heads to the Governor’s Desk for his signature.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Permanently Protect San Onofre State Beach Headed to Governor's Desk,2020-08-26,press_release,NA,"
 
SACRAMENTO — AB 1426 by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) to enshrine in state law a settlement agreement protecting San Onofre State Beach from infrastructure development passed the Assembly Floor on a bipartisan 61-10 concurrence vote. 
 
AB 1426 prohibits any transportation agency or government entity from authorizing, funding, or constructing any new infrastructure that encroaches on the land currently protected by a combination of San Onofre State Beach and the Richard H. and Donna O’Neill Conservancy.
 
For nearly two decades, a broad coalition of conservation groups have advocated against the use of the park in a proposal to build a multi-lane extension from the Foothill south toll road in Orange County south to Highway 5. This bill will put into law the settlement reached in 2016 between the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency (TCA), the Save San Onofre Coalition, and the State has prevented road construction to date.
 
“AB 1426 will make sure that the hard work and advocacy of everyone who has fought to keep this place protected cannot be undone,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “Protecting this park in statute will bring an end to the years of litigation, and today’s vote brings us one step closer to protecting this special place for future generations of campers, birders, hikers, fishermen, and surfers.”
As one of the top five most visited parks in the entire system, San Onofre State Beach and its last-of-its kind coastal watershed attract more than 2.5 million visitors every year. This popularity has driven thousands to organize in opposition to these construction plans on a scale unparalleled in the state’s history.
“Protecting San Onofre State Beach is critical to realizing the inclusive vision of the California Coastal Act,” said Ben McCue, Executive Director of Outdoor Outreach. “AB 1426 will help our state’s ability to provide for meaningful coastal experiences that enhance our communities’ health, wellness, and quality of life.”
 
“We are thrilled this historic park protection legislation is on its way to Governor Newsom’s desk,” said Stefanie Sekich-Quinn of the Surfrider Foundation. “The bill cements nearly 15 years of grassroots advocacy to permanently protect all the invaluable cultural, recreational and ecological resources at San Onofre State Beach.”
 
The realities of COVID-19 pandemic have made it clear just how essential access to natural places is to the mental and physical health of all Californians. This bill guarantees that one of the state’s most beloved beaches will remain undisturbed at a time when local trips to enjoy the outdoors are more important than ever.
 
AB 1426 enjoys broad support from a variety of conservation, labor, and business groups. It now heads to the Governor’s desk for his signature.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Economic Recovery Bill to Streamline State Work Sharing Program Passes Senate Labor Committee,2020-08-05,press_release,NA,"
SACRAMENTO — A bill authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) to streamline the application process for the state’s Work Share Program administered by the Employment Development Department (EDD), passed the Senate Labor, Public Employment, and Retirement Committee on a 4-1 vote. 
Work-sharing, or short-time compensation, gives employers the option of reducing employee hours during an economic downturn to avoid layoffs by providing the employee prorated unemployment benefit payments to replace the loss in wages. Despite the many benefits the program provides for employers and employees, this state program is currently underutilized because the application process can be administratively burdensome and the employers may not even be aware the program exists. 
""As our economy opens and closes to help manage the spread of the coronavirus, participating in the work share program is a better alternative to layoffs,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “AB 1731 will help employers retain trained workers, employees on reduced hours will keep their benefits, and the state will maximize federal dollars already allocated to fund the program by streamlining an application process that incentivizes employers' participation in the program. It’s a win-win for everyone.”
AB 1731would create a temporary, simplified work-sharing application process requiring EDD to deem all program applications approved upon receipt, send employers their claim packets electronically within 5 days after the application is approved, and promote the program by working with the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development and the I-Bank to share the benefits of the program when contacted by employers seeking assistance. 
AB 1731 is set to be heard next in the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Hosts Food Distribution for Hospitality Workers Impacted by COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-05,press_release,NA,"
VISTA— Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath joins volunteers from Unite Here Local 30 and Carlsbad Councilmember Cori Schumacher to host a drive-thru food distribution for hospitality workers at the North County Food Bank. Hotel workers in the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas, Oceanside, and Vista are some of the most severely impacted as a result of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In San Diego County, employment in the hospitality industry plummeted by about 50% in the one month between March and April as travel for work and leisure fell significantly in the wake of the pandemic. This means many of the staff from North County hotels and resorts have found themselves in need of other ways to support their families.
“I’m volunteering today to help provide some much-needed assistance to hospitality workers and spotlight the efforts happening in my district. As I’m sure you can imagine with three out of four direct hotel employees laid off or furloughed, putting food on the table and ensuring no child goes hungry is a top priority,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “I am so thankful for the regional leadership of the San Diego Food Bank and their focus on food insecurity during these challenging times.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 7.7M hospitality and leisure jobs were lost in April and with 70% of direct hotel employees laid off or furloughed, hotel workers are losing more than $2.4B in earnings each week. Unite Here Local 30 has noticed the human impacts of these numbers amongst the workers they represent.
""As the hotel workers union for San Diego County, the shock this pandemic has brought to the hospitality industry in North County is being felt acutely within the ranks of our membership,” said Rick Bates, Research Analyst for Unite Here Local 30. “More than a thousand of our members live and work in the North County cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas, Oceanside, and Vista, and are finding themselves without consistent work in the local hotel industry for the first time. 98% of our members throughout the county have been laid off or furloughed since the impacts really began to reach the industry back in March. Events like today’s drive-thru distribution are helping these workers to keep food on the table and bridge the gap until employers are able to bring more of them back on.""
Over 200 local hospitality workers were able to attend the distribution and stock up on various non-perishables and fresh grocery items. The North County Food Bank is offering daily drive-thru food distribution services for low-income families and those economically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. Families only need to verbally self-certify income level to receive assistance, and a volunteer will place the items in the trunk of their vehicle.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath’s Bill to Ensure Sustainable Fishing Moves Forward,2020-05-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO - Assemblymember Boerner Horvath’s bill to strengthen the structure of the marine hatchery program in Carlsbad, AB 1949, was unanimously approved by the Assembly Water, Parks, and Wildlife Committee.
The primary hatchery facility for the Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP) activities is the Leon Raymond Hubbard Jr. Marine Fish Hatchery in Carlsbad. The Carlsbad hatchery is the only marine fish hatchery in the state conducting research on marine species, their habitats and their survivability at a time when climate change severely strains the world’s oceans. AB 1949 ensures that the legacy of sustainability-based hatchery management can continue in coastal North County.
“I am proud to continue the good work of former State Senator Dede Alpert in support of the marine fish hatchery. The goal of this bill is to implement sound recommendations to ensure sustainable fishing,” said Boerner Horvath. “The program was established to evaluate the economic and ecological feasibility of releasing hatchery-reared fish to restore depleted, native, marine fish populations.”
In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) requested a California Sea Grant from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego to conduct a comprehensive review of the program. This review found the program could benefit from several improvements. AB 1949 strengthens the program’s advisory panel by facilitating a more direct decision-making process and providing stakeholders with more appropriate representation.
“I am pleased to join Assemblymember Boerner Horvath, conservationists, and the sports fishing community to provide more sustainable recreational opportunities through AB 1949. This legislation is a win-win for the natural environment and the economy, and it is my hope that today's action will encourage the entire Assembly to approve it soon,"" said State Senator Patricia Bates (R-Laguna Niguel), a principal co-author of AB 1949.
""On behalf of the Coastal Conservation Association of California (CCA-CAL), proud sponsors of AB 1949, we thank Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for her leadership in moving this bill forward. The Southern California sport fishing community supports the OREHP because it is critically important to our marine resource. AB 1949 updates past Ocean Resources Enhancement Advisory Panel legislation so that it will be able to continue its valuable marine research well into the future.”
The department administers the hatchery program with the assistance of the 10-member of the OREAP. The program is primarily funded by revenue from the federal Sport Fish Restoration Act and sales of California Sport Fishing Ocean Enhancement Stamps. The Assembly Appropriations Committee will consider the bill next.

Tasha Boerner,Boerner Horvath Holds Hearing to Identify Sea Level Rise Threats in the San Francisco Bay Area,2020-02-07,press_release,NA,"
FOSTER CITY, CA —Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas), Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Sea Level Rise and the California Economy, convened a second hearing to identify the most immediate coastal infrastructure threats to communities in the San Francisco Bay Area due to accelerating sea level rise. 
 
“We know the sea level is rising. This is not something out there in the future. It is happening now,” said Assemblemember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “At the state level, we want to work with coastal cities to find ways to prioritize a response to the rising seas and work in collaboration to best coordinate efforts into real change.”
 
The sea level has already risen eight inches along the San Francisco coast over the last century and it is expected to climb another 1 to 3.4 feet by 2100, according to the Ocean Protection Council’s State of California’s Sea-Level Rise Guidance 2018 Update. 
 
“Sea level rise is one of the most serious consequences of climate change,” stated Assembly Speaker pro Tempore Kevin Mullin. “San Mateo County has more people and property value at risk from rising sea levels than any other county in California, making it an ideal location to hold the Assembly Select Committee on Sea Level Rise and the California Economy’s second public hearing. While San Mateo County has taken a proactive approach to addressing this serious and unique issue by creating the first county-level agency in the state to address sea level rise, there is always more to learn.”
 
According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) report, Preparing for Rising Seas: How the State Can Support Local Adaptation Efforts, because the effects of sea level rise do not stop at the city border or county line, local jurisdictions would benefit from working together with their neighbors on a regional basis to collaborate on plans for addressing the interrelated impacts.
 
Warner Chabot, Executive Director at the San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI), confirmed, “The recent LAO report on sea level rise affirms what local governments, nonprofits, businesses, and other state agencies have been saying. It appropriately calls for state actions to support, fund and accelerate local, collaborative efforts.”
 
Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath re-established the select committee in 2019 to thoroughly review the challenges ahead in addressing the expected impacts of sea-level rise on coastal cities.
 
Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath represents the 76th District, which encompasses Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, Vista, Carlsbad, and Encinitas.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath Convenes Select Committee to Examine Impacts of Sea-Level Rise on Coastal Cities,2019-12-04,press_release,NA,"
 
ENCINITAS, CA—Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas), Chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Sea Level Rise and the California Economy, convened a hearing on December 3, 2019 examining “Sea-Level Rise and Its Impacts on Coastal Cities.” The hearing provided a broad overview on the status of sea level rise, immediate threats to the California coastline, and compared the current sea levels with the projected sea levels by the year 2050 and beyond.
 
“As a legislator from a coastal district, the issue of sea-level rise is very important for the safety, economy, and quality of life in my district. Just this past weekend, the bluff collapsed only feet from the railroad tracks in Del Mar along the LOSSAN corridor, which is the second busiest rail corridor in the nation,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “There are serious economic impacts from sea-level rise to our coastal communities and our state, estimated at approximately $150 billion in property at risk of flooding along the coast by 2100.”
 
Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath was joined by fellow Select Committee members Assemblymember Todd Gloria (D-San Diego) and Assemblymember Patrick O’Donnell (D-Long Beach), as well as State Senator Pat Bates (R-Laguna Niguel). The purpose of the hearing was to take a deeper look into the current data on sea-level rise and the regional, social, economic and environmental challenges, as well as management strategies. 
 
""The California shoreline is an invaluable recreational, commercial, and military asset, and it’s significant that the committee is prioritizing learning about the issues the coastline will face and potential solutions,” said Mark Merrifield, director of the Center for Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation at UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. ""Beach erosion, cliff collapse, and coastal flooding are ongoing management challenges, and sea-level rise rates are expected to increase significantly in coming decades. Coastal monitoring systems provide quantitative information about our evolving coastlines, and increasingly will be relied on by managers faced with hard decisions.”
 
The testimony addressed what the state is facing and regional solutions to sea-level rise. The Committee also heard testimony from the following experts:
 
Imperial Beach Mayor Serge Dedina, Encinitas Councilmember Kellie Hinze, and Oceanside Councilmember Ryan Keim also shared their experiences in protecting their coastal communities from rising sea levels.
 
“Climate change is the biggest threat we are facing, so focused conversations and action specific to our region are critical to ensuring the resilience of our infrastructure, built environment and natural resources,” said Encinitas Councilmember Kellie Hinze.
 
Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath represents the 76th District, which encompasses Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, Vista, Carlsbad, and Encinitas.

Tasha Boerner,Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath Presents $1.5 Million Check to MiraCosta College to Expand Veterans Center for Student Veterans,2019-11-07,press_release,NA,"
 
OCEANSIDE, CA—Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath (D-Encinitas) presented MiraCosta College with a $1.5 million check to expand the on-campus Veterans Center on November 7, 2019. The ceremonial check was given at the Veterans Day College Hour, which included a 1K Fun Run through campus followed by a cake cutting ceremony in honor of the Marine Corps birthday.
 
“As a representative of one of the largest military communities in our state, one of my top priorities is to ensure that our veterans receive the quality care, education and services they earned while serving our country,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “I am proud to have secured $1.5 million in the state budget to expand resources for veterans at MiraCosta College to help them transition from military to civilian life.”
 
Each year MiraCosta College serves almost 3,500 students who are veterans, active-duty personnel, or military dependents. The 1,424-square-foot Veterans Center will be housed in a new, one-stop-shop Student Services Building at MiraCosta College’s Pedley Park near the Administration Building. The $1.5 million in funding will help equip an 800 square foot lounge and resource area, in addition to offices for the veterans services program manager, a Veterans Administration representative and a trio of counselors, as well as a veterans patio. Computer stations and printers, a bolstered textbook loan program, and expanded outreach and communications to Camp Pendleton – the West Coast’s largest Marine Corps base and home to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force – are among the planned enhancements.
 
“The money will go a long way towards building the Veterans Center and will streamline access to veterans resources. These funds will allow MiraCosta College to be innovative in how we are our serving our military-affiliated students,” said Liz Draper, Program Manager of Veterans Services.

Tasha Boerner,Increased Representation of Women on Local Appointed Boards and Commissions with Signing of AB 931,2019-10-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA- Assembly Bill 931 (AB 931) was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on October 12, 2019. This bill increases the representation of women on local appointed boards and commissions. AB 931 seeks to remedy historical gender disparities in appointments to public, non-elected, non-salaried boards and commissions by requiring fair representation among men and women. 
“While women have made considerable advances in the workforce in recent years, they still face inequities that often prevent them from being part of the decision-making process and reaching their full potential. Depending on the board or commission on which they serve, appointees have the responsibility of making recommendations on issues pertaining to permitting, planning, traffic, public safety, parks and recreation, and environmental quality and standards. These are the nuts and bolts of the daily lives of Californians, and women’s voices need to be equitably heard,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath, whose own experience on a local planning commission served as a catalyst for this bill.
While the policy of the State is that the general public be represented within the composition of state boards and commissions, there has previously been no law that required such representation to be implemented at the local level. Women, who make up 52 percent of California’s population, have struggled to achieve fair representation on the various boards and commissions that govern much of their daily lives. AB 931 requires that local boards and commissions with five or more members have both genders represented, with no gender representing more than 60% of the membership. This bill also prohibits local boards or commissions with four or fewer members from being comprised exclusively of people with the same gender identity. AB 931 applies to cities with a population of over 50,000 people. 
“Fund Her, an organization dedicated to increasing the number of women in public service, is proud to stand with Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath in strong support of AB 931. This is a big step forward for California. By ensuring that women have access to gaining local government experience and using a public platform to serve in leadership roles at every level of government, we are empowering the next generation of women to serve this great state,” said Valerie T.

Tasha Boerner,Donation Drive Provides Diapers to Low-Income Families During Diaper Need Awareness Week,2019-09-23,press_release,NA,"CARLSBAD, CA— Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath recognizes Diaper Need Awareness Week with a diaper donation drive to support low-income families in the community. One of the most basic necessities for parents and their babies are diapers, which can be a significant expense. 
From childbirth to childcare, women often bear the main burden of essential items for their children. On average, babies go through approximately 6-8 diapers per day, costing about $1,000 a year to supply average-priced diapers for just one child. Low-income mothers must spend a greater portion of their money on food and housing, especially with the high cost of living in California, leaving even less money available to pay for diapers.
“As a mom, I know how vital diapers are for the health and well-being of children. The sales tax exemption on diapers in this year’s budget is a starting point for helping mothers with the costs of providing their children with necessary products to maintain health and hygiene,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “By eliminating the diaper tax, we are also making the tax code in California more gender-equitable.”
Diaper Need Awareness Week takes place from September 23-27, 2019. Donations of new, clean, unopened packages of diapers are being collected at the Assemblymember’s district office. All donations will be taken to the North County Food Bank to be distributed to needy families in the community. Diaper donations can be dropped off at the district office from 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday during Diaper Need Awareness Week.
The district office is located at 325 Carlsbad Village Drive, Suite A-2 in Carlsbad.

Tasha Boerner,Gender Pricing Small Business Notification Bill (AB 1607) Signed by Governor Newsom,2019-09-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA- Assembly Bill 1607 (AB 1607), authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath, has been signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 12, 2019. Known as the “Gender Pricing Small Business Notification,” this bill helps business owners avoid penalties and lawsuits by ensuring that they have the right information when it comes to pricing services for men and women.
“This bill is about educating business owners of their obligations under the law. My goal is to protect small businesses from costly fines that can have a serious impact, particularly for new business owners who are just starting out,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath.
AB 1607 requires cities and counties to issue a notice of the Gender Tax Repeal Act (1995) at the time a business license is issued or renewed. The Gender Tax Repeal Act prevents businesses from charging different prices for services based upon gender. 
“We applaud Assemblymember Boerner Horvath for authoring this important legislation that will protect small businesses from unnecessary lawsuits and allow them to continue to provide services to their customers,” said Jennifer Barrera, Executive Vice President of the California Chamber of Commerce. The California Chamber of Commerce is the largest broad-based business advocacy group in California and sponsored AB 1607.
AB 1607 will take effect on January 1, 2020.

Tasha Boerner,Asm. Tasha Boerner Horvath Releases Statement on AB 1482 Vote,2019-09-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA- Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath released the following statement upon her vote on Assemblymember Chiu’s Anti-Rent Gouging Bill (AB 1482) on Wednesday. 
“We are in the midst of a statewide housing crisis. For the first time, we are seeing ‘working homeless’ in our district — families who are working multiple jobs and living in our homeless shelters. There is no doubt that the kids of hardworking parents are not getting a fair shot at the American Dream. So many of our neighbors are just one rent-increase away from joining these families in our shelters and the streets.
“It is our tough job as a Legislature to stop talking and take urgent action to address the statewide housing crisis. We have run out of time. Today we have a solution before us to stop rent-gouging policies that displace families in our district, AB 1482 (Chiu). 
“To be clear — I voted no on this bill when it first came to the Assembly floor. In my opinion the original bill went too far, was too extreme and didn’t strike the right balance.
“However, the bill before us today is significantly improved and I am thankful the author has taken many of my amendments, including allowing no-fault evictions for renovations, excluding many non-corporate homes and owner-occupied duplexes, and ensuring that all criminal activity is just cause. I am committed to working with all parties to make improvements to these policies in the future, such as non-corporate 1-10 unit complexes.
“This is not rent-control, which I oppose. When tenants move out, when complexes are renovated, rents can be increased. Rents can be increased at reasonable rates that give our seniors certainty on fixed incomes. It has no impact on new construction of multi-family housing. The just cause clauses are reasonable and fair.
While it is still not perfect, it is a reasonable, immediate solution to keep our neighbors in our community. We must urgently continue to work on how to increase supply, together with local governments, that is compatible with our neighborhoods so that when this bill sunsets, it will no longer be necessary.”

Tasha Boerner,Equal Pay for Equal Play Bill (AB 467) Signed Into Law,2019-09-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA- Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath is pleased to announce Assembly Bill (AB) 467 was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. Also called the “Equal Pay for Equal Play” measure, AB 467 addresses long-standing gender pay disparities in competitive sports. This bill requires sports prize equity for both male and female participants in all sporting competitions held on state lands.
“I am humbled and honored to see this bill signed into law, advancing the historic efforts of so many athletes and advocates standing up for equality,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath. “The overwhelming bipartisan support of this bill demonstrates that the State Legislature and Governor Newsom have the backs of women and girls throughout California.”
AB 467 requires equal prize compensation for all athletes, regardless of gender, as a condition for approving a lease or permit request for any sporting event held on state lands. Event organizers will have to affirm equal pay prizes for both men and women at each participant level before the competition can move forward.
""California is undoubtedly one of the most influential places in the world so this bill is not just a gain for athletes, but sets precedence for women everywhere,” said Kim Woozy, Director of Skate Like a Girl San Francisco Chapter, who testified in support of AB 467. “I’m thrilled for the new possibilities AB 467 will open up for young girls and boys growing up in a world knowing there are laws upholding the notion that we are equal and will be compensated equally for the jobs we perform.”
While the bill specifically addresses sporting events held on state lands, it also tackles the larger issue of inequality that has long plagued the sports industry. Pay disparities exist in almost every major sport and change has been slow to come.
Kathryn Bertine, former professional cyclist and CEO of the Homestretch Foundation said, “The passing of AB 467 is not just a monumental moment in sports, but a societal shift toward equity and progress. We have moved the dial forward, proving that inclusion matters. I look forward to seeing the impact of this bill, not just in California, but nationwide. This is just the beginning of equal play for equal pay.”
AB 467 will take effect on January 1, 2020.

Tasha Boerner,Asm. Tasha Boerner Horvath’s Bill (AB 1017) Signed into Law to Improve Safety Standards for At-Grade Pedestrian Railroad Crossings,2019-09-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO, CA - Assembly Bill 1017 (AB 1017), authored by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath, was signed into law today by Governor Gavin Newsom. AB 1017 provides cities and counties with a safety assessment of planned at-grade railroad crossing projects before they submit applications to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for approval. This is Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath’s first bill to be signed into law.
“Adding and restoring connectivity in our rail corridor is a top priority for our district and our state. Making it easier for people to walk, bike, push strollers, or use wheelchairs to go to back and forth between our beaches, businesses, and residences means decreased greenhouse gas emissions and increased safety for residents and visitors alike,” said Assemblymember Tasha Boerner Horvath. “AB 1017 is a big step forward for our ability to plan and prioritize these types of crossings, and by providing technical information earlier in the planning process, we are saving taxpayer dollars.”
This bill makes engineers’ recommendations available to cities and counties during the planning process to reduce the number of changes, project extensions, and costs to cities for revisions once a plan has been filed with the CPUC. Incorporating a safety assessment in the midst of the planning process can reduce the danger at railroad crossings for pedestrians, as well as prevent costly project delays.
“The City of Encinitas is bifurcated by a railway, separating much of the City’s residences from the many businesses on Highway 101 and from the beach, which is a significant source of recreation for the community, as well as a popular destination for tourists,” said Encinitas Mayor Catherine Blakespear. “Safe locations to cross railways are critical for reducing transportation by motor vehicles and to increase pedestrian safety.”
“As someone who started down the path of public service as a mom trying to get a stop sign in her neighborhood, I think it is only appropriate that my first bill signed into law will help make our communities safer,” said Assemblymember Boerner Horvath “Commonsense solutions that make our lives better is why I came to Sacramento and I am thankful for Governor Newsom’s support of this measure and very proud to see this bill become law.”
AB 1017 will take effect on January 1, 2020.

Josh Hoover,Governor Newsom Vetoes Bipartisan Legislation Improving Accountability Over Homelessness Spending,2024-09-26,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) expressed deep disappointment following Governor Gavin Newsom’s veto of Assembly Bill 2903. The bill, which had garnered unanimous bipartisan support in the Legislature, would have required state-run homelessness programs to annually report cost and outcome data to the California Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH). It would have also required ICH to develop procedures for collecting the data and reporting it to the public.

“Governor Newsom had an opportunity to do what is right and hold his own agencies accountable for our state’s failed response to homelessness,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “Instead, he rejected the recommendations of the State Auditor and vetoed legislation that received unanimous support in the Legislature. Our state has spent billions of taxpayer dollars in recent years only to see homelessness get worse. We will not solve this crisis and get people the help they need until we get serious about accountability.”
AB 2903 sought to implement the recommendation of the California State Auditor following the results of a recent audit requested by Assemblyman Hoover. The audit revealed that the state has failed to systematically track homelessness spending and is not adequately positioned to collect data and assess outcomes.
According to the Auditor’s report, California has spent nearly $24 billion taxpayer dollars since 2018 to solve our homelessness crisis. During that same period the state’s overall homeless population increased by 32 percent and half of the nation’s unsheltered homeless now live in California.
“Californians deserve better,” Assemblyman Hoover added. “They deserve transparency and accountability in how their tax dollars are spent, especially on such a critical issue. I will continue to fight for meaningful reforms to address our state’s homelessness crisis.”

“Taxpayer-funded projects should be fully transparent, not shrouded in mystery. Yet information about the Capitol Annex Project continues to be hidden from the public. Now the Legislature is sending rocks to Italy to avoid its own labor standards.
“This decision not only conflicts with California’s own policy goals, but also raises serious questions about the project’s oversight and accountability.
“Californians deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent, especially on significant infrastructure projects like the Capitol Annex. If this truly is to be ‘The People’s House,’ it cannot be exempted from public scrutiny.”

Josh Hoover,Assemblyman Hoover urges Governor Newsom to Sign Legislation Improving Accountability Over Homelessness Spending,2024-09-03,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Saturday Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the passage of Assembly Bill 2903 out of the Legislature, which would require state-run homelessness programs to annually report cost and outcome data to the California Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH). It would also require ICH to develop procedures for collecting the data and reporting it to the public. The bill now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk after clearing the Senate and Assembly with unanimous bipartisan support.
“The State Auditor has made it clear what needs to change in our state’s approach to homelessness,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “Improving accountability over the dollars we are spending is the first step toward real reform. Spending billions of taxpayer dollars only to make the crisis worse is the definition of failure. I urge Governor Newsom to sign this bill and set California on a better path forward.”

Josh Hoover,Senate Education Committee Unanimously Approves Assemblyman Hoover’s Bill Limiting Smartphone Use in California Schools,2024-06-26,press_release,NA,"Sacramento – Today the Senate Education Committee unanimously passed landmark legislation authored by Assemblymembers Josh Hoover (R-Folsom), Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance), and Josh Lowenthal (D-Long Beach) to limit the use of smartphones in schools. AB 3216 would require school districts in California to adopt a policy no later than July 1, 2026 that limits or prohibits the use of smartphones by students during the school day. It was approved on a unanimous 7-0 vote.
“This is a critical step toward protecting and improving the mental health and academic outcomes of students across California,” said Assemblyman Josh Hoover. “Research continues to demonstrate the potential harms of smartphone use among children. The growing use of these devices in a child’s everyday life can contribute to lower test scores, anxiety, depression, and even suicide. Our state must take action to limit the use of smartphones during the school day and protect kids from these potential harms.”
Last week Governor Gavin Newsom came out in support of reducing smartphone use in schools and LAUSD, California’s largest school district, passed a new policy prohibiting smartphones during the school day. 
“I am pleased to join Assemblymember Hoover in this bipartisan effort to require California school districts to place limits on student smartphone use on campus during school hours, unless approved by teachers or administrators for academic, emergency, or other purposes,” said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, joint author of the bill and Chair of the Assembly Education Committee. “In 2019, I authored Assembly Bill 272, which was signed into law to encourage school districts to consider such limits. Since then, growing research shows excessive smartphone use not only interfering with learning but also contributing to teenage anxiety, depression, and cyberbullying. This bill will require all districts to develop their own appropriate policy to balance appropriate student use of smartphones at school with curbing the impact of excessive smartphone use on a student’s educational, social, and emotional well-being.”
Under current law, school districts are authorized to limit or prohibit smartphone use by students during the school day and many have done so with resounding success. Administrators have reported increased social interaction among peers, decreased instances of bullying on campus, and improvements in academic outcomes. A 2016 study found that when smartphones were removed from classrooms standardized test scores increased by an average of six percent, with even greater improvements among low achieving students. AB 3216 would continue to build on this success by expanding limitations on smartphones statewide.

A recent piece published in The Atlantic by NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt described a number of the potential harms that smartphone use is contributing to in children:

AB 3216 is critical legislation that prioritizes the needs of California students by limiting these potential harms during the school day, increasing social interaction among peers, reducing bullying, and improving academic outcomes. It will next move to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Josh Hoover,Joint Legislative Audit Committee Unanimously Passes Review of State Worker Return-to-Office Mandate,2024-05-14,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the passage of his proposed audit regarding the recent return-to-office (RTO) mandate for state workers. The requested audit was unanimously approved by the Joint Legislative Audit Committee on a 13-0 vote and will study the rationale, timing, legality, and costs associated with the decision to rescind telework privileges for state employees. By and large, state agencies have praised telework policies and the enhanced productivity they provide.
“The decision to force state employees back to the office is harmful and counterproductive,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “I am grateful for the support of my colleagues on my audit to further study the effectiveness of telework policies that allow the state to remain competitive with the private sector. I urge the Governor to reconsider his RTO mandate, at least until the results of the audit are made available.”
The California Department of General Services currently manages 59 state office buildings totaling over 13 million square feet of office space, and spends over $600 million per year on rent to maintain more than 2,000 leases for state departments in privately owned buildings. Telework has the potential to reduce this footprint and provide substantial budgetary savings.
Telework policies have also eliminated nearly 400,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, reduced traffic congestion, and saved workers hundreds of dollars per month in vehicle expenses.
”We have significant work to do to revitalize downtown Sacramento,” Hoover added. “Adding housing, addressing homelessness, and spurring economic development must all be part of the solution. But it should not be done on the backs of state workers.”

Josh Hoover,Statement from Assemblyman Josh Hoover following Oversight Hearing on Homelessness,2024-05-06,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) released the following statement regarding today’s oversight hearing on homelessness in Assembly Budget Subcommittee 7 on Accountability and Oversight:
“Today’s oversight hearing shined a light on a very troubling reality. After spending $24 billion taxpayer dollars on homelessness, our lead agencies in California have no idea where the money has gone or how many people it has helped. This is a complete failure of leadership by Governor Newsom and it’s time for the Legislature to demand more accountability.
“When pressed, representatives from the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and the Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH) admitted they have no data to share on existing homelessness programs and investments. In fact, ICH claimed they would need even more money to implement transparency measures recommended by the State Auditor. This is completely unacceptable.”
Assemblyman Hoover has authored AB 2903 to require state-run homelessness programs to annually report cost and outcome data to ICH. It would also require ICH to develop uniform procedures for collecting the data and reporting it to the public. This implements the recommendation of the California State Auditor following the results of a recent audit requested by Assemblyman Hoover, which found that the state has failed to systemically track homelessness spending and is not adequately positioned to collect data and assess outcomes.
According to the Auditor’s report, California has spent nearly $24 billion taxpayer dollars since 2018 to solve our homelessness crisis. During that same period the state’s overall homeless population increased by 32 percent and half of the nation’s unsheltered homeless now live in California.

Josh Hoover,Legislation to Increase Transparency and Accountability Over Homelessness Spending Clears Housing Committee,2024-04-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the passage of Assembly Bill 2903 out of the Assembly Housing and Community Development Committee, which would require state-run homelessness programs to annually report cost and outcome data to the California Interagency Council on Homelessness (ICH). It would also require ICH to develop uniform procedures for collecting the data and reporting it to the public. The bill passed with unanimous bipartisan support on a 9-0 vote.
AB 2903 implements the recommendation of the California State Auditor following the results of a recent audit requested by Assemblyman Hoover, which found that the state has failed to systemically track homelessness spending and is not adequately positioned to collect data and assess outcomes.
“Just one week after our audit blasted the state for its failure to track homelessness funding, Governor Newsom announced another $200 million in new spending,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “If we truly want to stop ‘funding failure,’ as the Governor claims, we must hold state agencies and homelessness programs accountable. I am grateful for the strong bipartisan support for this effort.”
According to the Auditor’s report, California has spent nearly $24 billion taxpayer dollars since 2018 to solve our homelessness crisis. During that same period the state’s overall homeless population increased by 32 percent and half of the nation’s unsheltered homeless now live in California.

Josh Hoover,Assemblyman Hoover Responds to Governor Newsom’s Counterproductive “Return To Office” Mandate,2024-04-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) released the following statement in response to the Newsom Administration’s decision to revoke existing flexibility for individual state agencies and implement a return to office (RTO) mandate for state employees by June 17, 2024:
“Governor Newsom’s decision to force state employees back to the office is harmful and counterproductive. This change in policy is not only harmful to thousands of my constituents who work hard serving California every day, it also severely undermines the state’s efforts to meet its climate goals and close its $73 billion budget deficit.
“I strongly urge the Governor to reconsider this RTO mandate and allow state agencies to continue harnessing the advantages of telework. While the Administration is moving backward, the Legislature is considering the expansion of telework options for its own employees.
“We have significant work to do to revitalize downtown Sacramento. Adding housing, addressing homelessness, and spurring economic development must all be part of the solution. But it should not be done on the backs of state workers.”
Assemblyman Hoover has formally requested an audit of the state’s RTO mandate questioning the rationale, timing, legality, and costs associated with the decision to rescind telework privileges for state employees. By and large, state agencies have praised telework policies and the enhanced productivity they provide.
The California Department of General Services currently manages 59 state office buildings totaling over 13 million square feet of office space, and spends over $600 million per year on rent to maintain more than 2,000 leases for state departments in privately owned buildings. Telework can reduce this footprint and provide substantial budgetary savings.
Telework policies have also eliminated nearly 400,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, reduced traffic congestion, and saved workers hundreds of dollars per month in vehicle expenses.

Josh Hoover,Assemblyman Hoover’s Legislation to Combat Fentanyl in Schools Approved by Public Safety Committee,2024-04-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Tuesday the Assembly Public Safety Committee approved Assembly Bill 2045, legislation authored by Assemblymember Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) to address the alarming rise of fentanyl in California schools and communities. The bill seeks to increase penalties on dealers who target schools and other community venues with deadly fentanyl. It passed with strong bipartisan support on a 7-0 vote.
“By supporting this bill, the Public Safety Committee has chosen to prioritize victims over criminals. Our number one job as lawmakers should be protecting our most vulnerable from harm,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “We must do more as a Legislature to create a safe environment where our children can learn, grow, and thrive. This legislation sends a clear message that those who endanger minors and bring deadly fentanyl into our schools will face severe consequences.”
AB 2045 brings penalties for fentanyl crimes in line with other hard drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. It does this by adding a one year prison enhancement for an adult who solicits, encourages, or intimidates a minor to possess fentanyl on the premises of a religious institution, playground, youth center, day care, or public swimming pool. It also provides a two year prison enhancement for the same crime if the offense occurs within 1,000 feet of a public or private school when children are present.
“We are currently losing over 100 Californians per week to a growing fentanyl crisis,” added Hoover. “Those who distribute this deadly drug in our communities must be held accountable.”
According to the CDC, fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin, 100 times stronger than morphine, and is a major contributor to fatal overdose deaths in the United States. In 2023 alone, 62,224 pounds of fentanyl were seized in California according to the National Guard. That is a 1066% increase in just 2 years.

Josh Hoover,Assemblyman Josh Hoover Announces Release of Bipartisan Audit of Homelessness Spending,2024-04-09,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the release of the State Auditor’s bipartisan audit of homelessness spending that he jointly requested with Senator Roger Niello (R-Fair Oaks), Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), and Assemblyman Evan Low (D-Silicon Valley). The focus of the audit was to determine whether or not recent investments in solving the state’s growing homelessness crisis have been effective at the state and local level.
“The results of this audit are a critical first step toward improving our investments, protecting taxpayers, restoring our public spaces, and getting people the help they need,” said Assemblyman Josh Hoover. “Now that we have identified the ineffectiveness and limitations of our current approach, it is now necessary for the Legislature to take action and improve accountability of the dollars we are spending.”
The audit is published in the following two reports, one focused on assessing spending in five state programs and the other focused on assessing spending by two local governments:
“Homelessness in California: The State Must Do More to Assess the Cost-Effectiveness of Its Homelessness Programs”
“Homelessness in California: San Jose and San Diego Must Do More to Plan and Evaluate Their Efforts to Reduce Homelessness”
The key takeaways from the State Auditor’s report include:
“Our current approach to homelessness is failing to get the results our communities need,” Assemblyman Josh Hoover added. “What this audit clearly shows is that the state continues to prioritize spending taxpayer dollars over getting actual results. We have to act to improve transparency and change this narrative.”
Since 2018 California has spent over $20 billion taxpayer dollars to solve the current homelessness crisis. During that same period the state’s overall homeless population increased by 32 percent and half of the nation’s unsheltered homeless now live in California. In Sacramento County alone, the homeless population has grown by 67% since 2019 and recently passed San Francisco.

Josh Hoover,Assembly Education Committee Unanimously Passes Bipartisan Bill to Limit Smartphone Use in Schools,2024-04-04,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – On Wednesday evening the Assembly Education Committee unanimously passed landmark legislation authored by Assemblymembers Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) and Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) to limit the use of smartphones in schools. AB 3216 would require school districts in California to adopt a policy no later than July 1, 2026 that limits or prohibits the use of smartphones by students during the school day. It was approved on a unanimous 7-0 vote.
“This is an incredible first step toward protecting and improving the mental health and academic outcomes of students across California,” said Assemblyman Josh Hoover. “Research continues to demonstrate the potential harms of smartphone use among children. The growing use of these devices in a child’s everyday life can contribute to lower test scores, anxiety, depression, and even suicide. Our state must take action to limit the use of smartphones during the school day and protect kids from these potential harms.”
Under current law, school districts are authorized to limit or prohibit smartphone use by students during the school day and many have done so with resounding success. Administrators have reported increased social interaction among peers, decreased instances of bullying on campus, and improvements in academic outcomes. A 2016 study found that when smartphones were removed from classrooms standardized test scores increased by an average of six percent, with even greater improvements among low achieving students. AB 3216 would continue to build on this success by expanding limitations on smartphones statewide.

“I am pleased to join Assemblymember Hoover in this bipartisan effort to require California school districts to place limits on student smartphone use on campus during school hours, unless approved by teachers or administrators for academic, emergency, or other purposes,” said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, joint author of the bill and Chair of the Assembly Education Committee. “In 2019, I authored Assembly Bill 272, which was signed into law to encourage school districts to consider such limits. Since then, growing research shows excessive smartphone use not only interfering with learning but also contributing to teenage anxiety, depression, and cyberbullying. This bill will require all districts to develop their own appropriate policy to balance appropriate student use of smartphones at school with curbing the impact of excessive smartphone use on a student’s educational, social, and emotional well-being.”
A recent piece published in The Atlantic by NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt described a number of the potential harms that smartphone use is contributing to in children:
AB 3216 is critical legislation that prioritizes the needs of California students by limiting these potential harms during the school day, increasing social interaction among peers, reducing bullying, and improving academic outcomes.

Josh Hoover,Assemblymembers Hoover and Patterson Introduce “Beyond Housing” Measure to Address Homelessness,2024-02-15,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblymembers Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) and Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) announced Assembly Bill 2417 to expand and improve California’s response to our state’s homelessness crisis. This legislation increases funding flexibility for treatment and service oriented programs by repealing the state’s existing one-size-fits-all “Housing First” approach to homelessness.
”Our current approach to homelessness is failing to get the results our communities are asking for,” Assemblyman Josh Hoover said. “We need a renewed focus not just on housing, but on getting people the necessary treatment they need to get out of the cycle of homelessness. It’s time for our state to support programs that are driving real change and getting people the help they need.”
Since 2018 California has spent over $20 billion taxpayer dollars to solve the homelessness crisis. During that same period the state’s overall homelessness population has increased by 32 percent and today half of the nation’s unsheltered homeless live in California.
“If we are serious about fully addressing the growing homelessness crisis, we must ensure we are treating the root causes of homelessness,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “Shelters without accountability have proven to be ineffective. AB 2417 will allow the existing successful programs in my district, and statewide, to focus their efforts on providing proven effective services to assist individuals in restoring and rebuilding their lives.”
AB 2417 shifts California’s focus “Beyond Housing” by recognizing that individuals experiencing homelessness have diverse needs and may require different pathways to stability. The bill would allow state agencies and departments to allocate funds to programs that prioritize mental health and drug treatment as a prerequisite for participation.
The proposed legislation comes in response to growing concerns over the shortcomings of the “Housing First” model, which has failed to adequately address the root causes of homelessness in many cases and has left many individuals without access to essential services. Moving “Beyond Housing” offers another tool in the toolbox for local governments as they seek to develop more holistic approaches to addressing homelessness.

“The City of Folsom extends its heartfelt gratitude to Assemblyman Josh Hoover for securing substantial state funding to bolster the Johnny Cash Trail Art Experience”, said City of Folsom Mayor Rosario Rodriguez. “This remarkable contribution will financially support Cash’s Pick No. 2, marking a significant milestone in the city’s efforts to install a world-class public art experience to celebrate and honor the legendary Johnny Cash, his music, and his connection to the City of Folsom. Just as Cash’s iconic career started with a humble guitar pick, soon, every walk, run, and ride on the Johnny Cash trail will begin with Cash’s iconic Pick. Each month, thousands enjoy the trail and its surrounding natural beauty, while enjoying the benefits of exercise. Thanks to this generous support, we can now integrate additional public art into the fabric of the Johnny Cash Trail, further enriching the experience for all who traverse it.”

Josh Hoover,Assembly Floor Approves Bill to Increase Access to Property Tax Exemption for Veterans,2023-06-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the passage of Assembly Bill 1361 (Hoover) from the Assembly Floor, a bill he authored to allow 100% permanent and disabled California veterans access to a property tax exemption prior to taking ownership of a home.
“Our state’s disabled veterans have sacrificed so much for our country and freedoms, the least we can do is give them greater access to a tax exemption that they already qualify for,” said Assemblyman Hoover. “Fixing this loophole in the law will provide financial relief to veterans and enhance their buying power when purchasing a home.”
The veteran property tax exemption already exists in the State Constitution, but veterans cannot qualify for it until after they own the home. During the underwriting process, taxes that veterans do not owe are collected and counted against them when qualifying for a mortgage. This means that thousands of dollars are collected at closing that will simply be refunded back to them at a later date. This places unnecessary burdens on veterans and decreases their buying power. AB 1361 would streamline this process by allowing them access to the credit prior to closing on the home.

Josh Hoover,Assembly Public Safety Committee Votes Down School Safety Legislation,2023-03-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced that the Assembly Committee on Public Safety rejected his bill, AB 257, which would have prohibited homeless encampments within 500 feet of a school, daycare center, playground, or youth center. The bill was killed on a 2-6 party line vote.
“This bill is about one thing and one thing only: ensuring the safety of our residents and kids near parks and schools,” said Assemblyman Hoover. “I am disappointed that my colleagues voted down this bill today, but I will not stop working to keep our communities safe.”
In 2022 alone there were three murders committed by homeless individuals in Assemblyman Hoover’s Sacramento County Assembly District. Last February, a 20 year old community college student in Rancho Cordova was raped and killed on the American River Parkway. In September, a Carmichael man was murdered in “an unprovoked and senseless homicide.” Then just three months ago a Rancho Cordova man was killed while riding his bike near a preschool.
San Juan School Board Member Saul Hernandez also participated in the hearing to testify in support, stating: “It only takes one unstable person to do irreparable harm, which makes allowing these encampments near our schools a risk we can’t afford to take. Parents should have the peace of mind that their children can walk or ride their bikes to and from school safely.”
Also testifying in support was Rancho Cordova City Councilmember Garrett Gatewood, who stated: “Homelessness is a humanitarian, environmental, and public safety crisis, but the collective failure to solve the homeless problem should not be compounded by further endangering our citizens and our children.”

Josh Hoover,Assembly Public Safety Committee Rejects Common Sense Legislation to Reduce Retail Theft,2023-03-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced that the Assembly Committee on Public Safety rejected his bill, AB 75, to restore pre-Proposition 47 penalties for serial theft offenders with multiple prior convictions. The bill was killed on a 2-6 party line vote.
“Residents and small business owners across our state are calling for common sense changes to Proposition 47 to restore accountability and provide relief from rising retail theft,” Assemblyman Hoover said. “A crime without consequences is no longer a crime. That is where we stand under the status quo. My bill sought to fix this by implementing reasonable penalties for repeat offenders, but unfortunately too many of my colleagues do not believe consequences are an effective means of deterring criminal activity.”
AB 75 would have given voters the opportunity to reform Proposition 47 in a meaningful way. A recent UC Berkeley/LA Times poll found that 78% of voters believe crime has risen over the past year and 59% would support increasing penalties on property crimes.
“Folsom businesses experienced $1.4 million in losses in 2021, including $353,000 in shoplifting alone,” testified Folsom Mayor and local small business owner Rosario Rodriguez. “It’s laws like Proposition 47 that make it very tough to do business in California because of a lack of accountability.”
Former Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness also joined the hearing to testify in support of the bill, stating: “While this bill will help small businesses and the community at large, we also have an obligation to the offenders themselves to ensure to the greatest extent possible that they do not reoffend and that they get on the path to a better life. [AB 75] offers that, Proposition 47 does not.”

Josh Hoover,Assemblyman Josh Hoover Introduces Legislation to Prohibit Homeless Encampments within 500 Feet of Schools and Parks,2023-01-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today Assemblyman Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) announced the introduction of Assembly Bill 257, which would prohibit homeless encampments within 500 feet of schools, daycare centers, parks, and libraries.
“As our local communities work toward mental health and housing solutions on homelessness, it is critical that the Legislature act to ensure our most sensitive public spaces are kept safe,” said Assemblyman Hoover. “No parent should be afraid to let their kids walk to school or worry about finding needles in the park where their children play, but that is the current experience for far too many families across our state. This legislation would change that.”
Last year several cities in California, including Sacramento and Los Angeles, voted for similar measures at the local level. Since 2019 homelessness in Sacramento County has grown by 67%, recently surpassing San Francisco for the first time.
As a new member of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee, Assemblyman Hoover also plans to propose an audit of statewide homelessness spending in the near future to provide more accountability and determine which programs are effective at reducing homelessness.

“I appreciate Governor Newsom’s proposed investments in flood protection and levee safety. I look forward to working with him to make sure Sacramento County receives adequate resources in these areas. However, I am disappointed that his budget does not make progress toward increasing water storage infrastructure that our state desperately needs to avoid rationing and prepare for future droughts.
“I am also glad to hear the Governor demand results and accountability on solving our homelessness crisis. That should start with a full audit of state homelessness spending in California, which I will be proposing later this year. His support for this audit would go a long way toward ensuring the results and accountability that he seeks.”

Joe Patterson,"Assemblymembers Joe Patterson and Juan Alanis Introduce Bill to Make Domestic Violence a Violent Felony, 3rd Time’s a Charm",2025-01-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) and Assemblyman Juan Alanis (R-Modesto) introduced AB 292 classifying felony domestic violence as a “violent felony.” AB 292 will hold the most violent domestic abusers accountable by making them ineligible for “early release.” This will be the third attempt at this legislation, after the bill was refused a hearing in 2024. This time, the legislation is being introduced with the support of the California State Sheriffs’ Association as the sponsor.
Statistics show that nearly two-thirds of mass shooters have documented histories of domestic violence or have killed a family member. This marks an increase from earlier years, underscoring the ongoing risk posed by violent offenders with such histories.
Patterson, a staunch advocate for public safety since taking office in 2022, is pushing for changes to California’s laws, which continue to allow convicted violent domestic abusers to serve shorter sentences and be released early under Proposition 57. “This issue is about more than dangerous relationships– it’s a much broader public safety crisis,” Patterson said. “The data speaks for itself: violent domestic abusers are the individuals most likely to commit mass shootings. We must address this problem at its root, or we risk continuing this cycle of violence.”
As Vice Chair of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Alanis has been a voice of reason defending critical public safety legislation. “Classifying domestic violence as a violent felony is a common-sense proposal that recognizes the profound harm victims endure,” said Assemblymember Alanis. “As a career law enforcement officer, I can tell you firsthand that responding to these incidents is among the most dangerous situations we can face. Domestic violence is violent assault and must be treated as such by state law.”
A prime example of the issue is Smiley Martin, the primary shooter arrested in connection with the 2022 Sacramento mass shooting. Martin was convicted in 2018 for a brutal domestic violence assault, during which he broke into his girlfriend’s home, repeatedly beat her with a closed fist, and dragged her outside by her hair. Despite serving only 4 years of his 10-year sentence, Martin was released early due to California’s classification of domestic violence as a “nonviolent” felony under Proposition 57.
“It should go without saying but felony domestic violence is an inherently violent crime,” said Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes, President of the California State Sheriffs’ Association. “As the Legislature continues to re-examine and adjust the violent felony list, adding felony domestic violence is an obvious way to increase accountability and protect victims.”
Under current law, many felony domestic abuse convictions are still considered “nonviolent,” making offenders eligible for early release after serving only 50% of their sentence. Furthermore, nonviolent felonies do not count as strikes under California’s three-strikes law, preventing prosecutors from seeking longer sentences for repeat offenders. A data report from the California Department of Justice indicates that domestic violence convictions are one of the leading indicators of future violent behavior, including mass shootings.
In response to this troubling trend, Patterson and Alanis have introduced AB 292 to reclassify violent domestic violence offenses as “violent crimes” under state law. The bill would also prevent early release for offenders with a history of severe domestic violence and strengthen penalties for repeat offenders. Assemblymembers Joe Patterson and Juan Alanis are hopeful this bipartisan bill will finally be given the attention it deserves.

Joe Patterson,"Re-elected Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces First Piece of Legislation to Halt Cost of Living Increases, Bring Transparency to Sacramento Bureaucrats",2024-12-02,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) was sworn into office for a second term in the California State Assembly. He immediately introduced legislation aimed at reining in unaccountable bureaucrats that make decisions that contribute to the most expensive electricity and gasoline prices in the nation. His legislation, AB 34, would require that the impacts of any new regulation proposed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) must first be analyzed by the non-partisan Legislative Analyst Office before they can be adopted. The analysis must include an assessment of the cost to Californians.
“The majority of Californians agree that it is far too expensive to live in this state,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “Our constituents are continually burdened by increases to utility and gas prices caused by an unelected group of Sacramento insiders.” 
Last month, CARB amended the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, resulting in anticipated gasoline increases up to 47 cents per gallon in 2025 and 52 cents per gallon in 2026. AB 34 would bring transparency and accountability to the unchecked rulings of CARB. 
“We cannot allow unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats to continue to drive up costs for Californians without legislative oversight,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “This proposal will be the first of many of my policies targeted at reducing and stabilizing the cost of living across the state.”

Joe Patterson,"Joe Patterson, Gallagher, Call on Newsom to Reconsider Refinery Storage Mandate, Delay LCFS Update",2024-10-30,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Following the announcements that Phillips 66 would close its California refinery and Valero was considering shutting down its facilities, Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) and Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher (Yuba City) are calling on Gov. Gavin Newsom to act to prevent more gas price increases due to disruptions in the state’s fuel market.
In a letter to the governor, Patterson and Gallagher called for a special session of the Legislature to reconsider the recently passed refinery storage mandate and requested Newsom delay his administration’s proposed update to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard that is projected to increase gas prices as much as 65 cents per gallon.
“The fallout from Gov. Newsom’s attacks on our energy industry has been swift and severe,” said Patterson. “California drivers are already paying some of the highest gas prices in the country – they can’t afford any more disruptions to our fuel supply. It’s time to make affordability a priority.”
In announcing the closure of its refinery, which accounts for 8% of California’s refining capacity, Phillips 66 cited “long-term uncertainty” regarding its ability to operate in the state as the reason for the shutdown. Days later, Valero’s CEO said “all options are on the table,” including the closure of its two California refineries, due to “the California regulatory environment.”
“California families are paying a high price for Newsom’s political stunts,” said Gallagher. “We need to undo the damage caused by Newsom’s extreme energy policies and act quickly to prevent things from getting even worse.”
According to industry experts, the California Energy Commission and the governors of Arizona and Nevada, Democrats’ gas storage mandate risks higher average gas prices and fuel shortages due to refineries being forced to withhold supplies from the market.
The Low Carbon Fuel Standard update is scheduled to be voted on by the Air Resources Board on November 8, just three days after the upcoming election. While the Air Resources Board refuses to disclose how they expect the new regulation to impact gas prices, they acknowledged it will have a cost to consumers. An independent study projected the update could raise prices as much as 65 cents per gallon.

California drivers pay the highest gas taxes in the nation, adding 88 cents per gallon to the cost of gas. Environmental mandates add an additional 45 cents per gallon, for a total added cost of $1.33. California gas prices are among the highest in the nation, and are currently $1.44 above the national average.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces Legislation to Freeze Governor’s Planned $0.47 Gas Price Increase,2024-09-11,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) introduced critical legislation designed to freeze proposed increases in gas prices. The bill, ABX2-4, targets the Newsom administration’s proposal to update California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which may result in an increase of 47 cents per gallon over the next year.
“Californians continue to identify the high cost of living as one of their biggest concerns with life in our state,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “Working families can’t absorb yet another state regulation that drives up the price of gas. The governor’s focus should be on ensuring that hardworking Californians can afford to live in this state rather than calling an extraordinary session to distract from the real problem.”
The governor called this extraordinary legislative session to introduce his proposal that his own administration says will increase the cost of gas.
“The Legislature should consider a variety of proposals to bring prices down during this special session, not just rubberstamp the governor’s plan,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “My proposal represents a simple way to prevent even more pain at the pump.”

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Statement on Newsom’s Sham Special Session,2024-09-05,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) condemned Gov. Newsom’s special session and called on Democrats to reject his proposal to withhold gas from California drivers, which Newsom’s own energy experts warn could drive up prices and create supply shortages.


“Californians are tired of getting ripped off at the pump thanks to Democrats’ high taxes and regulations – and they see right through Newsom’s attempt to blame everyone but himself,” said Patterson. “Newsom’s sham special session proposal will do absolutely nothing to address California’s outrageous gas prices and will likely drive costs even higher. I hope the majority party will support a transparent process that allows for bills from both sides of the aisle, instead of blindly doing the Governor’s bidding.”

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Honors Family of Fallen Hero Sergeant Nicole Gee,2024-05-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – This week, as we head into the Memorial Day holiday, Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) presented Assembly Concurrent Resolution 126 on the Assembly Floor to honor the life and sacrifice of Roseville hero Sergeant Nicole Gee.
With Sergeant Gee’s family present, inside the somber Assembly Chambers at the California State Capitol, ACR 126 passed unanimously off the Assembly Floor and will dedicate a portion of Interstate 80 in Sgt. Gee’s hometown of Roseville, California, between Douglas Boulevard and the junction of State Route 65, as “Nicole Gee Memorial Highway.” The ACR is coauthored by Senator Roger Niello (R-Fair Oaks).
On August 26, 2021, America and the world learned about a devastating suicide bomber attack that took the life of 13 service members during the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan. Sgt. Gee was one of those service members. Shortly after the bombing, one of Sgt. Gee’s social media posts of her cradling a small Afghan child with the caption, “I love my job,” circulated like wildfire and became an international symbol of our country’s kindness and goodwill. Sgt. Gee was just 23 years old when she was killed.
Born in Vail, Colorado, and raised in Roseville, California, Sgt. Gee graduated from Oakmont High School with a 4.1 GPA. She entered active duty in the United States Marine Corps in August 2017 and was assigned to Combat Logistics Battalion 24 and deployed with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit in February 2021. Her many commendable awards and achievements include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, NATO Medal, and Expert Rifle Qualification Third Award. She was a black belt martial arts instructor, set weightlifting records at Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, and achieved perfect scores in Combat Fitness Tests.
Patterson was elected to the Assembly in November 2022 and started the process for the highway dedication shortly after.
“By designating a portion of Interstate 80 in Placer County as U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Gee Memorial Highway we honor Nicole,” said Patterson. “We remember the joy she brought to everyone she knew, the light she was to others all around the world, and we will never forget the sacrifice she made for the people of this nation.”

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Takes Aim at Reducing Mass Shootings,2024-02-13,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) has reintroduced legislation intended to reduce mass shootings throughout the state by holding some of the worst domestic abusers accountable. Last year, his domestic violence bill received extensive media coverage and yet was killed on a party-line vote in the Assembly Public Safety Committee. AB 2470 would classify felony domestic violence as a “violent felony” and would make convicted felony domestic abusers ineligible for early release.
More than 68% of mass shooters have a documented history of domestic violence or have killed a family member.
By definition, domestic violence is violent; however, under current California law, in most instances, felony domestic abuse convictions are considered “nonviolent” and offenders are eligible for early release under Prop 57 after serving only 50% of their sentence. Additionally, nonviolent felonies are not considered strikes under California’s three strikes law, limiting prosecutors from seeking longer sentences for repeat offenders.
Patterson cites the 2022 Sacramento mass shooting by Smiley Martin as an example of how his bill could have stopped a mass shooting. Martin, the primary shooter arrested in connection with the killings, was previously convicted of domestic violence after breaking into his girlfriend’s home, beating her repeatedly with a closed fist on the face, head and body, and dragging her outside by her hair. Martin then shoved her in the car and continued beating her with a belt. He was convicted in 2018, but was released early having served only four years of his 10-year sentence. Within just a few months of being released early and despite being prohibited from owning a gun, Martin shot and killed 6 people.
“Whether you’re a Republican, Independent or Democrat, you can’t argue with the data,” Patterson said. “Statistics show that violent domestic abusers are the individuals most likely to commit mass shootings. If we hold them accountable, we will reduce mass shootings.”
Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire agrees. “Domestic and intimate partner violence affects every community, regardless of socioeconomic status,” Gire said. “It’s also a high indicator for future escalated violence. AB 2470 acknowledges these realities and allows prosecutors to hold abusers accountable to prevent future tragedies.”
Patterson has been a strong advocate for victims of violent crimes since being elected to office in November of 2022 and is continuing his promise to prioritize public safety.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces Legislation to Cut Electric Rates by 30%,2024-02-07,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin), along with Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher, introduced AB 2205 to direct the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to cut electricity rates for Californians by 30 percent. After seeing repeated proposals to increase rates due to various state mandates, Patterson introduced legislation to rein-in rates and give Californians a break from unsustainable and out-of-control electricity bills.
“Not a day goes by without someone contacting me about their unaffordable electricity bills” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “Nobody should have to choose between heating their homes and buying food. It is time for the CPUC to focus more on affordability of this necessary service.”
Californians have seen their electricity bills skyrocket as much as 127%, placing a huge burden on already-struggling families and small businesses. According to the Transparency Foundation and the CPUC itself, California’s electricity rates are double the national average, costing residents an extra $1,096 more per year than Americans living in other states. Much of this is due to unrelated mandates and causes that have nothing to do with providing electricity.
“The cost of electricity has squeezed Californians to a breaking point,” Patterson said. “Working families are afraid to turn on their heaters or air conditioner not knowing what their bill will be the following month. Too many Californians are struggling to make ends meet – bringing their electric bills down will ease that burden and improve people’s quality of life.”
Current California law allows the CPUC to regulate utility rate increases. Despite a requirement that these rates be “just and reasonable,” massive rate increases have been approved year after year. Patterson’s bill would mandate the commission lower the per kilowatt-hour charge to consumers by no less than 30 percent.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces Bill to Stop Transient Releases of Sexually Violent Predators,2024-02-01,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson (R-Rocklin) is continuing the fight to protect his community from an impending “transient release” of a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) into Placer County. With the California Department of State Hospitals (DSH) moving forward with the release, today he introduced AB 2035 to make clear that transient releases are a threat to safety and should not be allowed. AB 2035, a bipartisan measure, will define qualified housing in state law. Additionally, Assemblyman Patterson introduced AB 2036 to enhance victim notification of SVP releases.
Last year, community concerns were raised when DSH and their private contractor, Liberty Healthcare, proposed releasing Sexually Violent Predator William Stephenson on transient status. Stephenson, originally convicted in the 1980s for assault and intent to commit rape, was released from custody in 2014 and was subsequently re-arrested for possession of child pornography. DSH has proposed releasing repeat offender Stephenson on transient status which has a high failure rate. A transient release could involve placing the offender into a trailer or hotel.
“This is a huge concern for families and residents in my community,” Assemblyman Joe Patterson said. “The state has an obligation to find a lawful and suitable address for Mr. Stephenson that does not jeopardize the safety of the public.”
Assemblyman Patterson and his office have worked actively to oppose the release, submitting letters and statements to the court and attending hearings. Additionally, he has been working closely with Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire to halt the transient release.
“Transient release for sexually violent predators is a recipe for failure. Liberty Healthcare, the organization tasked with placing SVPs, has even noted that transient releases have a 50% failure rate and is not an ideal option for program participants,” said Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire. “AB 2035 will clarify that transient release is not qualified housing for a sexually violent predator and defines qualified housing in state law. We are grateful to Assemblyman Patterson for his continued commitment and leadership on this issue.”
“Legislators never intended to allow transient releases of SVPs,” Patterson said. “We must be very clear, those classified as SVPs must have suitable housing with constant, appropriate monitoring to ensure they don’t re-victimize and to keep our communities safe.”

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces Legislation to Stop the Transient Release of Sexually Violent Predators,2023-08-24,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO –Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Rocklin, submitted amendments to AB 1456 today to ensure the legislature puts a stop to releasing Sexually Violent Predators (SVP) on Transient Status. In response to thousands of residents voicing concern over a Placer County Superior Court ruling to release an SVP on Transient Status into his district, Assemblyman Joe Patterson commits to address this harmful practice.
“The Transient Release of Sexually Violent Predators has shown to have a mere 50% success rate with 1 in every 2 cases repeat offending. It is unacceptable to allow this harmful practice to continue,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “We must prioritize the safety and well-being of residents in our communities.”

With just three weeks left in the legislative session, Assemblyman Patterson took action and amended AB 1456 to begin the process of addressing this issue statewide and makes it clear that transient releases should not be allowed.
An SVP is an individual convicted of a sexually violent offense and diagnosed with a mental disorder that causes them to be a danger to others with a high likelihood to reoffend. By law, all conditional releases of SVPs must be monitored and supervised by the Department of State Hospitals. Adequate monitoring and supervision is severely impaired when an SVP is released on transient status without a designated address.

“The legislature never intended for transient releases to be allowed. This is a loophole that needs closing,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “The term Sexually Violent Predator is reserved for the most dangerous criminals. A transient release should not be granted under any circumstance.”
Assemblyman Joe Patterson is committed to public safety and ensuring the residents of Assembly District 5 are represented at the state level.
State Senators Roger Niello and Marie Alvarado-Gil are principal co-authors.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Opposes Sexually Violent Predator Release in Placer County,2023-07-28,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson joined Senator Roger Niello in sending a letter to Placer County Superior Court Judge Horst to oppose the release of a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) on transient status.
“I was previously a staff member for a legislator who co-chaired the High-Risk Sex Offender Task Force and authored the legislation to create the Sex Offender Management Board (SOMB). At no time did legislators ever discuss releasing Sexually Violent Predators as transients,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “In fact, legislators were very clear that SVPs needed secure housing and monitoring that would keep the community safe and ensure that they don’t re-victimize.”
Without a designated address, Stephenson’s release is considered a Transient Release. By law, all conditional releases of Sexually Violent Predators must be monitored and supervised by the Department of State Hospitals, including among others, 24-hour GPS monitoring, monitoring of any approved electronics, and unannounced searches. Previous transient release cases have shown to result in repeat offenses, especially with high-risk sex offenders like Stephenson.
“The term Sexually Violent Predator is reserved for the most dangerous criminals,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “A Transient Release should not be granted under any circumstance. It is the responsibility of our judicial system to prioritize public safety. I urge Judge Horst to reconsider this decision and demand that Liberty Healthcare do its job.”
Assemblyman Joe Patterson and Senator Roger Niello jointly sent a letter imploring Judge Horst to revisit his decision. “The safety and well-being of residents in our community should be of paramount importance,” the letter reads. “Given these standards, we are shocked that Mr. Stephenson would be deemed mentally fit and safe to reenter society. This is a man who has been given several chances to change, yet he has chosen to reoffend.”
Assemblyman Patterson encourages concerned residents to join him in opposing the transient release by submitting letters of opposition at www.placer.ca.gov/SVP. Residents can learn more about the case at www.placer.ca.gov/9217/Case-information-SVP-SCV-37867-William-S.
BACKGROUND:
Stephenson has a history of sexual violence dating back to the 1980s. He was sentenced to 30 years in state prison for his crimes. After being conditionally released in 2014, Stephenson violated parole bypassing electronic monitoring and was arrested for possessing child pornography. Stephenson was assessed as a high risk sex offender and committed to the Department of State Hospitals.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Successfully Advances Three Bills Addressing California’s Fentanyl Crisis,2023-05-23,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO-Three crucial pieces of legislation authored by Assemblyman Joe Patterson, AB 19, AB 889, and AB 890, successfully passed through the Assembly Floor today. This milestone marks a significant step towards safeguarding our communities and preventing further loss of life in the ongoing fight against California’s escalating fentanyl crisis.
AB 19, the first of the three bills, ensures all 10,000 public schools in the state maintain two doses of naloxone, a life-saving medication used to reverse the effects of fentanyl poisoning. By equipping schools with this vital resource, Assemblyman Patterson seeks to mitigate the risks posed by fentanyl exposure and provide immediate assistance to affected students, staff, and visitors on campus.
Recognizing the importance of raising awareness and education among parents and guardians, AB 889 requires schools to annually inform the 6 million students and families in California about the dangers associated with fentanyl. Assemblyman Patterson believes that informed parents and guardians are better equipped to recognize the warning signs and take proactive measures to protect their children.
Furthermore, AB 890 addresses the need for intervention and accountability for individuals involved in fentanyl-related crimes. This legislation requires those convicted of such offenses to participate in a probation class specifically tailored to fentanyl. By emphasizing the consequences and risks associated with fentanyl, Assemblyman Patterson aims to deter future criminal activity. AB 890 is sponsored by Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire.
All three bills authored by Assemblyman Joe Patterson achieved bipartisan support, signaling a collective determination to address California’s fentanyl crisis across party lines.

Joe Patterson,Democrats deny another Republican bill hearing,2023-04-25,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Yesterday, Democrats denied another important Republican bill hearing. Assemblyman Joe Patterson’s AB 1554, co-authored by Republican Leader James Gallagher, would have streamlined badly-needed fuel reduction projects such as tree thinning, pruning, prescribed burning, and roadway clearing in moderate, high, and very high fire hazard zones. This reasonable measure would address an issue that has ravaged both of their districts yet couldn’t even get a hearing for discussion.
Patterson and Gallagher’s AB 1554 was scheduled to be heard at 2:30pm in the Assembly Committee on Natural Resources. With the analysis written and talking points ready, Assemblyman Joe Patterson was surprised to receive a message from committee staff stating that if he did not take amendments that gutted the bill, the committee would refuse to even consider the proposal. Assemblyman Joe Patterson asked again for the opportunity to present the bill as written and was told no.
AB 1554 is an important bill for districts still recovering from the devastating effects of the Mosquito Fire, Caldor Fire, and Camp Fire. Even Governor Newsom recognizes the importance of this policy, issuing an executive order granting a CEQA exemption, like the ones AB 1554 would provide, for 35 fuel reduction projects spanning 90,000 acres just a couple years ago. Agencies reported these projects were successful. Now is the time to expand the effort to include fuel reduction projects statewide.
“It’s disappointing to see such unilateral control from one party. This bill was not political,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. “My job as a legislator is to advocate for the needs of my district. It is dangerous for the Assembly to not even hear bills that would protect my residents, their businesses and homes.”
“It is a slap in the face to fire victims to refuse to hear a bill to speed up and streamline wildfire prevention programs,” said Gallagher. “Denying bills like this a vote in committee is completely undemocratic. Perhaps a Campaign for Democracy is needed right here at home.”
Assemblyman Joe Patterson is committed to addressing the growing wildfire concerns of his district and is hopeful the Assembly will reconsider hearing this important bill.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson’s Legislation to Address the Fentanyl Crisis Pass Education Committee,2023-04-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, the Assembly Education Committee unanimously passed AB 19 and AB 889, two bills authored by Assemblyman Joe Patterson to address the growing Fentanyl crisis. The Assemblyman has now successfully moved three pieces of legislation regarding Fentanyl out of policy committees.
AB 19 is landmark legislation and will ensure school campuses have at least two doses of naloxone hydrochloride, commonly known as Narcan. Narcan is a life-saving medication distributed via a non-invasive nasal spray. This legislation comes at a critical time with nearly 110 Californians dying from Fentanyl every week. AB 19 has been the subject of widespread media coverage and interest. Assemblymembers Matt Haney and Liz Ortega are joint authors of the legislation.
AB 889 will require public schools to annually inform parents and guardians of the dangers associated with using synthetic drugs at the beginning of the first semester or quarter of each regular school term.
From day one, Assemblyman Joe Patterson has been true to his promise to tackle the Fentanyl crisis. “The growing Fentanyl concern must be addressed with a multi-pronged approach,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “While we fight to hold dealers and sellers accountable, we must also educate our students and families and ensure we have life-saving treatments on every campus.”
AB 889 and AB 19 now move to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson’s Bill to Address the Fentanyl Crisis Passes Public Safety Committee,2023-03-21,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Today, the Assembly Public Safety Committee passed Assemblyman Joe Patterson’s AB 890 to help combat the growing Fentanyl crisis in our community. The historically difficult committee for Republicans approved his legislation with bi-partisan support.
AB 890 will require individuals granted probation for committing crimes such as selling or distributing Fentanyl, to take a probation class developed by the California Department of Public Health.
“Tackling the Fentanyl crisis has been a top priority of mine. I am committed to addressing this crisis from every angle,” said Assemblyman Joe Patterson. AB 890 is just one of four bills Assemblyman Joe Patterson has introduced specifically addressing Fentanyl, each approaching the epidemic with powerful solutions: preventative student and parent education, accountability of dealers and sellers, life-saving medication in schools and effective rehabilitation programs. The Assemblyman’s multi-pronged approach is providing extensive opportunities for legislators to join this important effort.
With AB 890 having passed the Public Safety Committee, Assemblyman Joe Patterson is a strong leader taking action at the state level to address the growing Fentanyl epidemic.

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Introduces Bill to Bring Transparency and Accountability to Secret Early Release Credit System,2023-02-17,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Rocklin, introduced legislation aimed at bringing transparency and accountability to a credit system currently allowing the secret early release of inmates by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).
Under Prop 57, inmates can earn credits for good conduct, education and rehabilitation, but the calculations of this secret credit system are unknown. When releases are made under a Prop 57 Parole Review, the District Attorney and victim are notified of the release; however, CDCR is releasing inmates without notification by issuing credits and deeming the sentence completed after serving only a fraction of the sentence.
“I support proven rehabilitation programs, but the reality is that inmates are now being secretly released and earning credits automatically,” said Assemblyman Patterson. “Our local District Attorneys are seeing criminals, denied parole, released back into communities to repeat offend, without notification to the District Attorney or victim. This cannot continue unchecked.”
AB 1260 will require advanced notification to local District Attorneys of the credit calculations determined for the early release of inmates. This legislation would require the notification to include the length of the sentence imposed by the court, the amount of time the sentence was changed by each category of credit awarded or denied, and the percentage of the length of the sentence that the inmate has served compared to the original sentence.
“Our victims and communities deserve access to information regarding inmates being released into their neighborhoods,” said Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire about AB 1260. “Just as the front end of the criminal justice process demands transparency, so must every step in that process. We are simply asking for accountability regarding these program decisions like we would any other policy program. Our residents deserve nothing less and I appreciate the opportunity to work with Assemblyman Joe Patterson on this important issue.”

Joe Patterson,Assemblyman Joe Patterson Response to Governor Newsom’s Budget,2023-01-10,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Rocklin, today made the following statement in regards to Governor Newsom’s 2023-24 Budget Proposal. Assemblyman Patterson pledges to fight for the quality-of-life residents enjoy in Placer and El Dorado Counties while ensuring that his constituents have a voice in the State Legislature.
 “Today the Governor revealed his 2023-24 state budget proposal facing a $22 billion deficit just one year after a record surplus of $98 billion. Unfortunately, our state wasted away a lot of those dollars and didn’t spend enough on one-time expenses improving our water storage, roads, or fire prevention and now we are stuck facing painful cuts.”

“I am pleased that the Governor recognizes the importance of my legislation to put Narcan/naloxone in schools to help combat fentanyl poisoning occurring to our youth. The Governor has included $3.5 million for schools to purchase at least two doses, which is aligned with the goals of my legislation, Assembly Bill 19.”

If passed and signed by the Governor, AB 19 would require every public school in California to maintain two doses of naloxone on campus. Click here for more information.

Joe Patterson,"Joe Patterson Sworn Into Assembly, Introduces Legislation to Combat Fentanyl Crisis",2022-12-05,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, Calif. – Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Rocklin, today took the oath of office as the new representative for the 5th Assembly District in Sacramento, vowing to prioritize issues and problems facing constituents in his district. Assemblyman Patterson pledges to fight for the quality-of-life residents enjoy in Placer and El Dorado Counties while ensuring that his constituents have a voice in the State Legislature.
“As a father of four, I have always believed that families should have the opportunity to raise their children in a safe and prosperous place, while feeling they always have a voice in Sacramento. Serving my community on the city council as mayor, I am eager to bring my local experience and the voices of my constituents to the State Capitol.”
Within an hour of being sworn into office, Assemblyman Patterson introduced two bills to combat a critical issue in his district, AB 18 and AB 19, to fight the fentanyl crisis in the state. Both of these bills are a part of a robust bill package that Assemblyman Patterson plans to introduce as the Fentanyl Crisis Legislative Package. 
“The real epidemic in my district is kids’ access to deadly counterfeit pills. Fentanyl-related deaths in in Placer County increased 450% between 2019 and 2021 with half of the victims being under 25 years old. Placer County’s one pill can kill campaign has done tremendous work and I am committed to addressing the most pressing concerns in my district and that starts with the safety of our kids and young adults.”
AB 18, will provide written notice to a person convicted of trafficking Fentanyl detailing that he or she may be convicted of murder, if as a result of selling the drug, another person dies. This measure will provide a legal deterrent to people who peddle this poison and will ultimately hold drug dealers accountable.
AB 19, requires each school to have no less than two doses of Narcan onsite to be available to aid kids suffering from an opioid overdose or poisoning. This measure will ensure that our schools are prepared for the potential of a fentanyl overdose.
Patterson represents the new 5th Assembly District, which is comprised of the communities of Roseville, Rocklin, Lincoln, Granite Bay, Auburn, North Auburn, Loomis, Meadow Vista, Newcastle, Penryn,
El Dorado Hills, Cameron Park, Diamond Springs, Placerville, Shingle Springs, Auburn Lake Trails, Georgetown, Cold Springs and Coloma.

Leticia Castillo,Assemblywoman Castillo Unveils Bold Plan for Government Transparency and Accountability,2025-02-11,press_release,NA,"[Sacramento, CA] – In a move to strengthen oversight and improve the efficiency of government programs, Assemblywoman Leticia Castillo has announced the introduction of her Government Accountability Package, a set of bills designed to ensure responsible spending and transparency across critical state programs. With billions of taxpayer dollars allocated annually to address homelessness, mental health, and economic security, this legislative package aims to hold the government accountable to the people it serves.
“The people of California deserve a government that is transparent, efficient, and accountable for how it spends public funds,” said Castillo “This package is a critical step in ensuring that our most vital programs deliver results for our communities.”
The Government Accountability Package consists of three key bills, each targeting specific areas where oversight and transparency are urgently needed:
Each of these bills reflects a commitment to fiscal responsibility, program effectiveness, and public trust. By mandating independent evaluations and increasing transparency, the Government Accountability Package empowers both lawmakers and the public with the information needed to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.
“We cannot afford to continue pouring billions of dollars into programs without ensuring that they are effective,” said the Assemblywoman. “This package is about smart governance — making sure that our investments are delivering real, measurable outcomes.”

Leticia Castillo,We Stood Up & Delayed the Radical Agenda of the Supermajority,2025-01-30,press_release,NA,"Today, California Democrats convened a special session to “Trump-Proof” the state — urging the body to pass a bill that could potentially use your taxpayer dollars to shield convicted felons that are in our country illegally from federal law enforcement.
But, thanks to the boldness of my office and Assemblyman DeMaio, we forced them to delay and deliberate. Before we introduced critical amendments to SBX1-2, Democrats recessed after session started for an extended period of time, scrambling to decide how it would look if they voted down common-sense protections.
My amendments to the funding measure were simple and clear: California should NOT be using state funds to obstruct the prosecution of criminals — especially those convicted of child trafficking, child pornography, violent crimes, drug trafficking, and other heinous acts. Yet, without these amendments, taxpayer money could still flow to groups that help convicted criminals evade justice.
“Protecting our communities should not be a partisan issue — it should be common sense,” stated Assemblywoman Castillo. “The overwhelming passage of Proposition 36 shows that Californians are fed up with soft-on-crime policies. These amendments simply uphold the will of the people.”
We may not be able stop every bad policy, but today, we slowed them down — forcing Democrats to a conversation they didn’t want to have. And we will keep fighting for accountability, public safety, and responsible use of taxpayer dollars.
Thank you for standing with us in this fight.

Leticia Castillo,Assemblywoman Leticia Castillo Introduced First Bill Aimed at Promoting Adoption for Teens Facing Unplanned Pregnancies,2025-01-28,press_release,NA,"Assemblywoman Leticia Castillo today announced the introduction of her first bill in the California State Assembly, aimed at expanding education about adoption as a viable option for teens facing unplanned pregnancies. Assembly Bill 329 seeks to ensure that high school sexual education curricula includes comprehensive information about adoption as part of family planning education.
“Adoption is a worthy option that is often overlooked in discussions about unplanned
pregnancies,” said Assemblywoman Castillo. “This bill empowers teens with knowledge about the adoption process, connecting them to resources and support so they can make informed decisions for themselves and their futures.”
AB 329 amends the California Education Code to require that adoption is thoroughly covered in health and sexual education classes, which is currently vaguely outlined in the state requirements. The bill will focus on providing accurate and unbiased information about the adoption process, legal rights, and the availability of counseling and support services.
Key provisions of the bill include:
“By promoting adoption education, we are giving young people more options and ensuring that no one feels forced into a decision due to a lack of information, support, or resources,” Assemblywoman Castillo added. “This legislation is about empowering teens and fostering a culture of support and understanding.”

Leticia Castillo,**Media Advisory** California Legislator Commends Efforts to Protect Migrant Children and Teases Upcoming Action,2025-01-27,press_release,NA,"Sacramento, CA – In light of recent reports highlighting the alarming disappearance of over 325,000 unaccompanied migrant children in the United States, California Assemblywoman Leticia Castillo praised ongoing efforts to address this humanitarian crisis while signaling forthcoming legislative action to support children’s safety.
Over the weekend, investigative journalist Sara Carter, alongside Goya Cares and former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan, revealed troubling new details about the fate of missing migrant children who arrived in the U.S. under the Biden Administration. Their work underscores the critical need for immediate action to protect vulnerable children from exploitation and trafficking.
Assemblywoman Castillo commended President Donald Trump for his administration’s emphasis on securing the southern border and prioritizing the safety of children caught in the immigration system. “President Trump’s leadership highlighted the importance of addressing the humanitarian aspects of border security. We must continue to build on those efforts to ensure every child is accounted for and safe,” Castillo stated.
To further these efforts, she plans to introduce an Assembly Joint Resolution urging the federal government to take decisive action. This resolution will call for comprehensive measures, such as:
“This isn’t just about policy—it’s about protecting innocent lives,” Assemblywoman Castillo added. “I am proud to stand with those who are working tirelessly to bring this issue to light and am committed to taking meaningful action to address this crisis.” Further details about the Assembly Joint Resolution will be announced soon.

Heather Hadwick,Hadwick and Dahle Block Harmful Proposal to Restrict Coyote Management,2025-02-12,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – In response to widespread concerns from farmers, ranchers, and rural communities, the California Fish and Game Commission has referred the controversial coyote reclassification proposal back to the Wildlife Resources Committee for further review. Assemblywoman Hadwick (R-Alturas) and Senator Megan Dahle (R-Bieber) had strongly opposed the initial recommendation in a letter, citing its potential to restrict rural agricultural communities’ ability to manage coyote populations effectively.
The proposal, which was initially advanced on January 15th without sufficient public notice, sparked significant backlash due to its lack of transparency and failure to include input from affected communities. Hadwick and Dahle raised concerns about the potential consequences of limiting predator management, emphasizing the risks exposed to livestock, pets, and public safety in rural and agricultural areas.
“The decision to pushforward with this change without consulting those directly impacted was irresponsible,” said Assemblywoman Hadwick. “I’m pleased that the issue has been referred back to committee, where it can receive the full, transparent review that our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities deserve.”
Coyotes pose a significant threat to livestock, causing economic hardship for agricultural producers and contributing to rising food prices. With the issue now back in committee, Hadwick and Dahle are urging the Commission to ensure a thorough review process that includes input from those most affected. They remain committed to advocating for responsible wildlife management policies that protect both rural livelihoods and public safety.
 
Assemblywoman Hadwick represents the 1st Assembly District, which includes portions of El Dorado and Placer counties, along with Alpine, Amador, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, and Siskiyou counties.

Heather Hadwick,Assemblywomen Hadwick and Sanchez Take Aim at Arsonists with Tougher Penalties,2025-01-23,press_release,NA,"Legislation introduced to hold arsonists accountable as California battles record-breaking wildfires and devastating losses. 
SACRAMENTO – Amid California’s relentless wildfire crisis, Assemblywomen Heather Hadwick (R-Modoc) and Kate Sanchez (R-Temecula) have introduced bold legislation to crack down on arsonists with tougher penalties for those who ignite catastrophic fires.
Seven of the ten largest fires in California history have occurred within the last five years, burning a staggering 3.8 million acres. Alarmingly, an estimated 20 percent of wildfires are the result of arson, destroying hundreds of thousands of acres across the state. The 2024 Park Fire, which burned over 400,000 acres and destroyed 709 homes in Butte and Tehama counties, was ignited by an arsonist with an extensive criminal record. Moreover, arson arrests have significantly increased over the past decade, according to CalFire.
AB 297 would add a sentencing enhancement of three to five years for arsonists whose actions result in the burning of 500 or more acres of forestland.
“As a former county Emergency Manager, I have personally worked on wildfires started by arsonists and have witnessed firsthand the devastation it caused. We need more tools to enforce the law and support our communities and that includes harsher consequences for highly destructive behavior,” said Assemblywoman Heather Hadwick.
“There is zero excuse for arson. These criminals knowingly cause fires that cost people their homes and lives. Our bill provides law enforcement more tools to keep these dangerous arsonists out of our communities,” said Assemblywoman Kate Sanchez.
Assemblywoman Hadwick represents the 1st Assembly District, which includes portions of El Dorado and Placer counties, along with Alpine, Amador, Lassen, Modoc, Nevada, Plumas, Shasta, Sierra, and Siskiyou counties.
Assemblywoman Sanchez represents the 71st Assembly District, which includes the cities of Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, Temecula, Murrieta, Wildomar, and unincorporated areas of French Valley, Temecula Wine Country, and Orange County.

Heather Hadwick,Newsom’s Administration Votes to Increase Gas Prices Again,2025-01-22,press_release,NA,"SACRAMENTO – To nobody’s surprise, the California Air Resources Board voted today to update the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and increase gas prices. Despite estimates this vote could spike prices by another 65 cents a gallon and demands for more transparency from lawmakers, journalists and the public, the board approved the new regulation.
The vote to increase gas prices comes after Newsom’s special session on gas prices, where new regulations have caused refiners to consider pulling out of California.
“This is just the latest example of Newsom and his Democrat allies in the Legislature screwing working Californians with even higher costs,” said Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher (Yuba City). “Californians have been clear: they cannot afford the higher gas prices this new rule will cause. Democrat politicians have stood in the way of every effort to stop this price spike – they will have to answer to their outraged constituents when gas prices jump yet again.”
Republicans in the Assembly have called on the governor to stop the expensive new regulation and avert a massive increase in gas prices.
