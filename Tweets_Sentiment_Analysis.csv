The program will grant vouchers worth up to $2,000 so that they may purchase an eligible, new electric bike.

"622","sencabaldon",2024-09-13 22:17:01,"""The person who clearly will represent the larger needs of the state and Napa County in this seat is Democrat Christopher Cabaldon, the two-decade-plus mayor of West Sacramento, who transformed an afterthought of a municipality into one of the state‚Äôs great turnaround cities. The board was impressed with the depth of his knowledge in education, land use and water issues. His plans to bolster wildfire mitigation as well as work to make community college free also resonated with us.  District 3 has no large municipalities within its boundaries, meaning the person in that seat must be an effective advocate for small and mid-size cities as well as rural areas. We felt Cabaldon understands this, particularly when it comes to housing equity and development issues.  Too much of the time, he told us in our interview, policies are focused on the state‚Äôs megalopolises, assuming that what works in Los Angeles will work in Calistoga; what makes sense for the Tenderloin also makes sense for American Canyon. Forcing cities, regardless of their size, to do things one way will only work for so long, he said. Collaboration is key. We agree and feel Cabaldon is best suited to put a nuanced plan into action."" https://t.co/I6v8NHC22V via @NapaRegister",0.183333333333333,"positive"

While this is an open discussion with no detailed plans, removing the ‚Äúnon-game mammal‚Äù status of coyotes could mean having to buy a tag, establishing seasons and setting bag limits, and having to seek a warden‚Äôs permission through a depredation permit to stop coyotes that are attacking livestock.    There is no scientific basis for establishing limits the way the Fish and Game Commission does for deer, ducks or other animals that we are trying to protect from over-hunting. These predators are more than abundant in rural areas and even in California‚Äôs suburban neighborhoods.    Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the state protections for predators ‚Äì including bears and lions ‚Äì and new limits on the ability of everyone from full-time ranchers to families with backyard chickens to protect their animals. And that‚Äôs not even counting the spread of gray wolves, which enjoy the strictest legal protections even as they prey aggressively on cattle herds. Adding new protections for coyotes is the last thing rural communities need.

Through MIAP, which relies primarily on private donations, over 2,000 veterans have been laid to rest across the nation. Having courageously served his country in Vietnam as a young man, Salanti's later years were marked by his unwavering commitment to his fellow veterans. He tirelessly supported services at the Redding CalVet home in Shasta County and took immense pride in ensuring that veterans, whose remains had been forgotten, received the proper military honors they deserved through MIAP, an organization he founded. His life exemplified heroism and service in its truest form. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family.",0.160919540229885,"positive"

Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano, a twice deported Mexican illegal alien, had a lengthy rap sheet prior to killing 19-year-olds Anya Varfolomeev & Nikolay Osokin in the DUI crash on the 405 freeway in Seal Beach in November 2021. Both were US citizens, and they were dating. Ortega-Anguiano had several felony convictions, had gone to state prison, and had multiple convictions for driving without a license, but was still on the streets when he crashed into the teens' vehicle.  In spring of 2022, Ortega-Anguiano was convicted in OC of two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated for killing the teens, and a judge sentenced him to serve 10 years in prison for each count, but concurrently, meaning he would serve both 10-year-sentences at the same time.  The victims' families felt that was already a weak sentence, but they tell me they were notified by the CA Department of Corrections on Easter Sunday that Ortega-Anguiano is scheduled for an early release on July 19th, 2025, only a little more than 3 years into his sentence, leaving the victims' families shocked, and outraged given the seriousness of the crime and his prior criminal history. They provided us the CDCR document showing the July 19th release date.  The CA Department of Corrections wouldn't confirm the release date when I reached out, saying they ""cannot provide information on an incarcerated person's release date or location in advance of their release.""
