**Objective:** Web scrape information about all current California State
Senators. Save output as a .csv file. Use `CA_Senate.Rproj` to run files. 

**Files:**

-   `RileyBerman_CA_Senate_Combine.R`: Web scrape using `rvest` from a
    few websites to compile a dataset of California State Senators with
    relevant information. Outputs `CA_State_Final` as a .csv file to the
    folder `CA_State_Combined`.

-   `CA_State_Combined` : Contains `CA_State_Final.csv` and
    `CA_State_Final_Updated.csv`, which is an updated version of the
    former with a complete list of twitter handles.
