**GitHub Suggestions for Group Members**

1. If you want to modify an existing file on GitHub, please first *test* it, by [cloning the repository to your own local computer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and creating your own branch. You can then push that branch to the main repository and integrate those changes pending a review by other members.
2. If you are uploading an R file (or some other file) to GitHub, please comment out your code (not extensively, just perhaps the difficult parts) and please place at the top (i) *the contributor(s)* (ii) *a short description of the code* (iii) *the methodology used.* Use ``RileyBerman_DataHack_CAAssembly.R`` for reference. 

Thanks!
