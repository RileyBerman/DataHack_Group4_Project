**GitHub Suggestions for Group Members**

1. If you want to modify an existing file on GitHub, please first *test* it, by [cloning the repository to your own local computer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and creating your own branch. You can then push that branch to the main repository and integrate those changes pending a review by other members.
2. If you are uploading an R file (or some other file) to GitHub, please comment out your code (not extensively, just perhaps the difficult parts) and please place at the top (i) *the contributor(s)* (ii) *a short description of the code* (iii) *the methodology used.* Use ``RileyBerman_DataHack_CAAssembly.R`` for reference.
3. GitHub limits the size of files allowed in repositories (50 MB or less), so Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) has been used to upload the larger .csv files. If you want to download these files, you will have to [install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) on your computer. 

Thanks!
