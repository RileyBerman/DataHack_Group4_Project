**Objective:** Web scrape information about all current California State
Assembymembers. Save output as a .csv file.

**Files:**

    few websites to compile a dataset of California State Assembymembers with
    relevant information. Outputs `CA_Assemby_Final` as a .csv file to the
    folder `CA_Assemby_Combined`.

-   `CA_Assemby_Combined` : Contains `CA_Assemby_Final.csv` and
    `CA_Assemby_Final_Updated.csv`, which is an updated version of the
    former with a complete list of twitter handles.
