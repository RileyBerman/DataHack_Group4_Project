**Objective:** Web scrape information about all current California State
Assemblymembers. Save output as a .csv file. Use `CA_Assembly.Rproj` to run files. 

**Files:**

-   `RileyBerman_CA_Assemby_Combine.R`: Web scrape using `rvest` from a
    few websites to compile a dataset of California State Assemblymembers with
    relevant information. Outputs `CA_Assemby_Final` as a .csv file to the
    folder `CA_Assemby_Combined`.

-   `CA_Assemby_Combined` : Folder containing `CA_Assemby_Final.csv` and
    `CA_Assemby_Final_Updated.csv`, which is an updated version of the
    former with a complete list of twitter handles.
