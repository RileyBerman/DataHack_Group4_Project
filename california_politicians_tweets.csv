Events to commemorate this period in history are being held all over the state of California including a bus trip I co-sponsored from San Jose to Sacramento. Please take a minute to read the captions under the photos to see where some of these events took place.
 
As many as 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians and nearly 60,000 American soldiers died during the Vietnamese War.
 
Today for the first-time the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag was flown across the street from the Capitol in Sacramento. It was a powerful message to future generations that the thousands who sacrificed their lives so they could have the opportunity of freedom will never be forgotten.
 
The County of Santa Clara, California has one of the largest Vietnamese-American populations outside of Vietnam. I have been honored to represent the Vietnamese-American community as a school board member, a San Jose City Councilmember, a Santa Clara County Supervisor and now as a state Senator.
 
I authored the resolution allowing the South Vietnamese flag to fly legally anywhere in San Jose and Santa Clara County. The South Vietnamese flag is recognized by the city of San Jose, the County of Santa Clara and the state of California as the official heritage flag of Vietnamese Americans in California."

This is in honor of the dedicated efforts of human-milk donors, milk banks, health care providers, and advocates who work tirelessly to ensure that all infants have access to life-sustaining breast milk.

I will present SR 20 on the Senate floor next week. 
 
Nonprofit milk banks serve these special needs, address disparities in access and education, and ensure there are safe processes for those donating and receiving donor breast milk. There are only two non-profit milk banks in California: Mothers‚Äô Milk Bank California in Santa Clara County and UC Health Milk Bank at UC San Diego.

SenMeganDahle,2025-05-07 22:08:16+00:00,"For the second time this year ‚Äì though now with proper public notice, after Assemblywoman Hadwick and I joined the ag community in calling for a new hearing in February‚Äì a committee of the state‚Äôs Fish and Game Commission on May 15th plans to discuss changing regulations on the take of coyotes. While this is an open discussion with no detailed plans, removing the ‚Äúnon-game mammal‚Äù status of coyotes could mean having to buy a tag, establishing seasons and setting bag limits, and having to seek a warden‚Äôs permission through a depredation permit to stop coyotes that are attacking livestock. 
 
There is no scientific basis for establishing limits the way the Fish and Game Commission does for deer, ducks or other animals that we are trying to protect from over-hunting. These predators are more than abundant in rural areas and even in California‚Äôs suburban neighborhoods. 
 
Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the state protections for predators ‚Äì including bears and lions ‚Äì and new limits on the ability of everyone from full-time ranchers to families with backyard chickens to protect their animals. And that‚Äôs not even counting the spread of gray wolves, which enjoy the strictest legal protections even as they prey aggressively on cattle herds. Adding new protections for coyotes is the last thing rural communities need. 
 
I am very grateful for the county sheriffs from around the North State who have joined in one voice to oppose any changes, which will not keep their communities safer."

This development underscores the critical importance of being #ReadyforWildfire. One of the most effective ways to ensure safety is by signing up for emergency alerts, which provide timely information and instructions during wildfire events.

It's crucial to recognize that 95% of wildfires are caused by human activity. Therefore, taking proper precautions to prevent wildfires is everyone's responsibility. Simple actions such as following fire safety guidelines and avoiding activities that can spark fires are vital in reducing the risk.

ShannonGroveCA,2024-09-26 21:33:30+00:00,"Today marks an incredible victory for California children. With the signing of my bill, SB 1414, we are reaffirming our commitment to safeguarding the most vulnerable among us‚Äîour children. SB 1414 (Grove) increases the penalty for soliciting or purchasing a child for sex from a misdemeanor to a felony, with a caveat that 16 and 17-year-olds must be proven victims of human trafficking. Criminals have been far ahead of us when it comes to child sex trafficking, we must have a strong approach to eradicate this brutal crime and ensure no child is reduced to a commodity.

The enactment of both of my bills, SB 14 last year and SB 1414 today, provides a significant step in the right direction to protect our children from both child sex traffickers and buyers. This is a crucial step, yet there is still work to be done. My pledge to champion protections for ALL children in California remains unwavering."

SB 1270 backs the Market Enforcement Branch, providing a vital resource for farmers facing contract issues. By streamlining the process and protecting billions in agricultural commodities, this bill ensures our farmers can thrive.

Additionally, SB 974 directs funding from lithium production back into Kern County, supporting our community's needs and solidifying our position as the energy hub of California. Together, we are securing a brighter future for all in Kern County. #SupportKernAg #EnergyHub"

It was a tearful, powerful and moving day in the capitol, highlighting the immense emotion and stakes invested in how California chooses to deal with homelessness going forward.
 
We're incredibly thankful for Senator P√©rez's leadership and personal testimony that helped push this bill forward. P√©rez shared how losing family members to homelessness motivates her to find humane solutions for addressing the crisis that has only become more severe since the Covid pandemic. As P√©rez said, unhoused individuals are people with humanity, and it is our duty to protect their rights. To the unhoused individuals who testified in support, we express immense gratitude for coming out and explaining why this bill is necessary. Your work is noticed, appreciated, and we could not do it without any of you.

SenBrianJones,2025-04-23 17:11:14+00:00,"Absolutely heartbreaking. The deaths of Anya Varfolomeev and Nikolay Osokin were entirely preventable. California‚Äôs sanctuary state policies and soft-on-crime approach are to blame.

Now the Newsom Administration is compounding that tragedy by releasing their killer ‚Äî a twice-deported illegal immigrant with a violent record ‚Äî after serving just 3.5 years of a 10-year sentence. What message does that send? That in California, justice is optional and innocent lives are expendable.

Even worse, because of our sanctuary laws, there is no guarantee this violent offender will be handed over to ICE. He could end up right back in our communities, as he has before, putting more lives at risk. UNACCEPTABLE!

That‚Äôs why I introduced Senate Bill 554. It requires law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities when it comes to convicted, violent illegal immigrants like Ortega-Anguiano. Safety must come before sanctuary.

SB 554 will be heard in the Senate Public Safety Committee next Tuesday. I urge my colleagues to take a hard look at what happened to these two young people, and ask themselves how many more lives will be lost before we fix these dangerous policies. #FixCalifornia"
BillMelugin_,2025-04-23 13:18:42+00:00,"EXCLUSIVE: The families of two teens killed by an illegal alien who crashed into them while drunk, high, & speeding at 100 mph in OC in 2021 have been told by the state of CA that their killer will be released from prison early in July, just 3.5 years into a 10-year sentence for killing the teens, who both burned alive.

Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano, a twice deported Mexican illegal alien, had a lengthy rap sheet prior to killing 19-year-olds Anya Varfolomeev & Nikolay Osokin in the DUI crash on the 405 freeway in Seal Beach in November 2021. Both were US citizens, and they were dating. Ortega-Anguiano had several felony convictions, had gone to state prison, and had multiple convictions for driving without a license, but was still on the streets when he crashed into the teens' vehicle.

In spring of 2022, Ortega-Anguiano was convicted in OC of two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated for killing the teens, and a judge sentenced him to serve 10 years in prison for each count, but concurrently, meaning he would serve both 10-year-sentences at the same time.

The victims' families felt that was already a weak sentence, but they tell me they were notified by the CA Department of Corrections on Easter Sunday that Ortega-Anguiano is scheduled for an early release on July 19th, 2025, only a little more than 3 years into his sentence, leaving the victims' families shocked, and outraged given the seriousness of the crime and his prior criminal history. They provided us the CDCR document showing the July 19th release date.

The CA Department of Corrections wouldn't confirm the release date when I reached out, saying they ""cannot provide information on an incarcerated person's release date or location in advance of their release."" They added that ""incarcerated persons may earn credits for participating in rehabilitative programming, which may move parole eligible dates to an earlier date.

ICE confirms to @FoxNews that they have placed a detainer on Ortega-Anguiano with the CA Dept of Corrections and intend to take him into custody upon his release. They hope the CA Dept. of Corrections will honor the detainer request and transfer him to their custody upon his release, which they often do. But the families fear, even if he is deported, he will just re-enter the US as a gotaway, as he's done twice before."
